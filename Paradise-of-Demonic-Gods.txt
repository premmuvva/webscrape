Chapter 1 Demonic City<br/><br/>In the year 2035 came the shocking news of a great explosion occurring in the airspace above one of the biggest cities in Xin Country – Roiling Ocean City. Not only did the landmarks and geographical areas in its surroundings abruptly undergo a huge transformation, but an otherworldly dimensional-gap also appeared in the skies. This caused a part of the current world to partially merge with the Other World.<br/><br/>Afterward, the city underwent a series of transformations which led other people in the world to name it Demonic City, one which had caught the attention of countries worldwide.<br/><br/>From the time of the great explosion until now, it had already been sixteen years. And at this very moment, Fang Xingjian, sixteen years of age, was standing atop a bluestone bridge, practicing his Basic Sword Technique.<br/><br/>He had learned this set of Basic Sword Technique from a common martial school. Although it was simple, it contained the full set of basic sword moves which were essential knowledge for every practitioner in Demonic City.<br/><br/>An hour later, under the glare of the winter sun, drops of perspiration were shining on Fang Xingjian’s body. The vigorous set of movements had made his muscles heat up repeatedly, tempering them.<br/><br/>After finishing his set, Fang Xingjian gradually pulled his sword back, meanwhile focusing his attention on the Stats Window in his brain.<br/><br/> Name<br/> Fang Xingjian<br/> Age<br/> 16<br/> Occupation<br/> Warrior’s Squire<br/> Level<br/> 9<br/> Strength<br/> 9<br/> Agility<br/> 9<br/> Reaction<br/> 6<br/> Endurance<br/> 6<br/> Flexibility<br/> 6<br/> Basic Sword Technique<br/> Level 3 (15325/32500)<br/> Single-handed Sword Grab<br/> Level 2 (23455/42200)<br/> Cross-slash<br/> Level 2 (11325/23900)<br/><br/><br/>Those who had experienced the transformation were akin to people in an MMORPG world; they could level up and even add points to their stats. Within the circumference of the world in Demonic City, everything had undergone a core transformation, while the original laws and physics of the world no longer applied here. Ever since Demonic City and the Other World had merged together, all material objects within the boundaries of the city manifested as if they had entered the Other World. When material objects entered Demonic City, they would undergo a change where their information would be presented as data and statistics. Naturally, this also applied to humans.<br/><br/>For example, earlier, when Fang Xingjian had been practicing the basic sword skills, he had gained experience in both the Basic Sword Technique and the Single-handed Sword Grab. As long as he kept practicing, and as long as he met the requirements, his level of proficiency in these two techniques would naturally rise.<br/><br/>Those with good talent would gain a lot of experience points after each practice session, and would also require little experience in order to advance to the next level. Not only that, if one’s talent was great enough, the level of one’s techniques could break into level 10, 12, 13, and even level 15!<br/><br/>However, Fang Xingjian knew what his own talent amounted to. Based on the large amount of experience points he needed in order to advance to the next level, he knew that his talent was only average. At most, he would only be able to train the three techniques he was practicing up to level 10.<br/><br/>Cautiously, he put the long training sword away. Each and every one of his training weapons had been bought with the savings he had managed to put together cent by cent. Thus, he cared for them a great deal.<br/><br/>Next, Fang Xingjian took up the hundred-jin-heavy steel greatsword lying by his side. The greatsword was a blunt, monolithic practice tool, which sacrificed all other factors in favor of weight.<br/><br/>With Fang Xingjian’s physical strength, both his hands trembled as he lifted the greatsword. His agility also slowed extremely when he tried to execute sword techniques with the weapon, facing extreme difficulty in using it.<br/><br/>After practicing only half a set of the Basic Sword Technique, he could not bear it anymore. The sword fell to the ground with a clatter, spidery cracks appearing on the ground from the impact. Fang Xingjian drew in huge breath after huge breath, both his arms aching with pain and soreness, unable to lift the greatsword again.<br/><br/>“This won’t do, I’m still so far away from the realm of ‘lifting a heavy object as though it were light’.”<br/><br/>The state where one had the ability to wield a hundred-jin-heavy sword whilst dancing about as though wielding a common sword was called ‘lifting a heavy object as though it were light’. Legend said that this was a standard originating from the Other World. It would only be achievable when one’s strength, agility, endurance, and flexibility stats each reached 10 points or more.<br/><br/>Strength, agility, reaction, endurance, and flexibility were known as the ‘five major attributes’.<br/><br/>The strength attribute represented the ability to fight against resistance, in motion.<br/><br/>The agility attribute represented the muscles’ actions: the contractions of one’s muscles, as well as their explosive strength.<br/><br/>The reaction attribute represented the level of efficiency with which the brain processed information input. The combination of the agility and reaction attributes represented the speed of each movement one could make in battle.<br/><br/>The endurance attribute represented the muscles’ and the heart blood-vessels’ endurance. The higher the stats, the more times one could execute one’s techniques.<br/><br/>The flexibility attribute represented the degree of ease with which one could perform actions. The higher the stats were for the flexibility attribute, the steadier one’s strength and speed, and the closer one would be to the maximum value of damage range. The attack’s explosiveness would also be stronger, and the chance of injury reduced.<br/><br/>However, the five major attributes’ effects did not grow in direct proportion to the number of stat points. 10 stat points in the strength attribute would give you more than a few times’ increase in strength, compared to having only 5 stat points. It did not simply mean a two-fold increase in strength.<br/><br/>Reaching the state of ‘lifting something heavy as though it were light’ also meant that strength, agility, endurance, and flexibility had at least 10 stat points each, allowing one to move as fast as a galloping horse, and to have strength akin to a water buffalo. Each punch or kick would be enough to kill an ordinary person.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian was currently wielding the greatsword not because he wanted to test the depths of his strength, but to temper and train his various attributes.<br/><br/>After putting the greatsword away, Fang Xingjian ended his morning practice and started washing his body before changing into a blue shirt and black suit.<br/><br/>The shirt’s color had already faded from repeated washing, and the western suit had shrunk so much that it no longer fit him. Despite this, he was still wearing them. It was obvious how bad Fang Xingjian’s financial situation was.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian walked out of the small courtyard, his eyes falling on layers and layers of fascinating and enchanting Chinese-styled courtyards.<br/><br/>On his way, he saw many muscular guys clad in western suits, patrolling. There were also several ladies clad in white who were watering the flowers, sweeping the floors, and doing miscellaneous chores. As they saw Fang Xingjian approaching, all of them bowed and called out, “Young Master Fang.”<br/><br/>They appeared to be part of a great clan of ancient tradition, emanating the attitude of a wealthy family.<br/><br/>In fact, as one of the Five Great Clans in the current Demonic City, the Fang Clan was comparable to a feudal clan from ancient times.<br/><br/>The Fang Clan, history told, was a great feudal clan which had been in existence for more than two hundred years. In the previous era, during their most glorious times, they had owned over ten thousand mu[1] of fields, over a hundred businesses, and countless slaves, servants, and beautiful concubines.<br/><br/>However, about one hundred years ago, their previous accumulated wealth had all been exhausted. With the dawn of the new era, they experienced a huge transformation. The Fang Clan was terrified that Xin Country would want to deal with the great clans of the old era, and thus they turned to hiding overseas, re-establishing their roots there.<br/><br/>It was not until twenty years ago when the country’s actions had become open and forthright and the international situation had turned volatile that the Fang Clan had moved their business back within Xin Country.<br/><br/>Four years after their return to the country, about sixteen years ago, the descent of the Other World had occurred. Outside Demonic City, everything had stayed the same, but those within it had become inhabitants of the transformed world. Countless people made use of this chance to rise, venturing into the Other World. After they came back, because of their huge increase in power, they accomplished many heaven-shocking and earth-shattering deeds.<br/><br/>Out of the people who came back, the five strongest ones’ families became known as the Five Great Clans, and Fang Clan was one of the five.<br/><br/>It was a pity that the Fang Clan’s lord had died in a battle in the Other World, seven years ago. Gradually, the Fang Clan had begun to decline, and eventually, it had become the weakest member of the Five Great Clans.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian walked through the long corridor and stepped into the dining hall. On the seat of honor there was a middle-aged woman, her beauty and grace evident despite her years. The woman’s rich black hair was meticulously tied up, and she was wearing red-colored western attire with an upright collar, along with brightly shining high heels. Overall, she appeared to be very strict.<br/><br/>The corners of her eyes slightly curled upwards, and her sword-shaped eyebrows also angled upwards as she stayed silent, fierceness radiating from her features. With a single look, one could tell that this person was difficult to communicate with.<br/><br/>Only through extremely thorough scrutiny would one be able to notice the deep traces of fatigue marked by the furrows on her forehead.<br/><br/>The Old Granny had been focusing her attention on a document in her hand, and only when Fang Xingjian had entered the dining hall did she raise her head to look at her grandson[2], indifferently uttering, “Sit.”<br/><br/>This person was currently in charge of the Fang Clan. She was Fang Xingjian’s maternal grandmother, the forty-nine-year-old matriarch of the Fang Clan, Li Shuanghua.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian cautiously sat upright towards the front of his chair, his back straight, his buttocks only taking up one-third of the seat.<br/><br/>Beside him was a couple over the age of thirty. They were none other than his mother’s brother and sister-in-law, Fang Xingjian’s second uncle and second aunt.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian smiled as he nodded to his second uncle. His second uncle looked as though he wanted to say something, but was stopped by his wife, and could only cast a helpless glance at Fang Xingjian. In recent years the clan of his second uncle’s wife had been rising in prestige and had gained a great increase in strength. This had allowed her words to hold more weight at home. In the past, his second uncle had always managed his wife strictly, but now, it was the opposite, as he followed obediently and acted in accordance to everything his wife said.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian had never been highly regarded in the family. Usually, only his second uncle would talk to him, asking him about his life. But now that his second uncle was being controlled so strictly by his wife, the latter had stopped talking to Fang Xingjian.<br/><br/>Ever since they had married, there had been no news of any pregnancy, which was also the reason why the Old Granny disliked his second uncle’s wife. If it were not for the fact that his wife’s family had risen in prestige during the past few years, the Old Granny would have already forced his second uncle to divorce long ago.<br/><br/>With the exception of the Old Granny, the three of them sat upright, and none of them dared to speak. Based on the current tyrannical strength of the Old Granny, in addition to her presence as someone in charge of a great feudal clan, no one dared to go against her words. Basically, in this place, her words were the law.<br/><br/>After fifteen minutes, the Old Granny frowned, making the three of them nervous as they watched her put the document away. Before glancing up, she instructed a female servant, “Xing, go and see why Third Master is taking so long. Get him here in five minutes.”<br/><br/>[1] classifier for fields/unit of area equal to one fifteenth of a hectare<br/>[2] The Fang Clan is Fang Xingjian’s mother side of the family. For unknown reasons, Fang Xingjiang has taken on his mother’s surname instead of his father’s. Generally, daughters and their children are valued less, since a daughter is generally ‘married out’ of her own family into her husband’s.

Chapter 2 Assignments<br/><br/>No sooner had the Old Granny given the command, than a loud commotion rang out as Fang Xingjian’s third uncle, Fang Yueming, walked in with a smile. “Mother, no need to call for me. Am I not already here now? Sigh, I was so busy last night… What good food is there to eat?”<br/><br/>Second aunt laughed coldly to herself as she thought, ‘What could he possibly be busy with? He probably stayed at the casino the whole night and didn’t come home until morning.’<br/><br/>The Old Granny picked up her chopsticks and whacked third uncle’s hand, which had been reaching out towards the dining table. “How many times have I told you? We can only start eating when everyone has arrived. You have no manners at all!”<br/><br/>“Mother, it’s because I’m hungry...” Third uncle felt grieved.<br/><br/>“You are really…” Looking at her youngest son, whom she pampered the most, the Old Granny’s heart softened. But she still replied sternly, “Bear with it, we will be starting the meal soon.”<br/><br/>While they were talking, third aunt had already carried a dignified and strong-looking four-year-old child into the room. When the Old Granny saw this grandchild of hers, the frozen expression on her face immediately melted, and she broke into a rare warm smile. In this family, the Old Granny was fondest of third uncle’s family.<br/><br/>Third aunt also smiled. Then, looking at third uncle, who seemed very sleepy with his pair of panda eyes, she gave him a harsh kick. Fang Xingjian knew that his third aunt was also a tough character. Her family held military power while she herself, though shrewd and unkind, was especially good in getting into other people’s good books. Not only third uncle, even the Old Granny liked her a lot. Furthermore, after giving birth to a son four years ago, the Old Granny now liked them even more.<br/><br/>Seeing this, second aunt became increasingly unhappy, throwing a harsh glance at second uncle, who only laughed.<br/><br/>The Old Granny calmly said, “Let’s start the meal.”<br/><br/>Maids entered like flowing water right away, setting down the cutlery, lifting the lids of various pots, and pouring wine and juice.<br/><br/>With a word from the Old Granny, everyone at the dining table immediately started looking alive. Fang Xingjian carefully ate the food in front of him, while second uncle occasionally got food for his wife.<br/><br/>Third uncle could not wait any longer, grabbing a chicken drumstick and digging in under third aunt’s annoyed glare.<br/><br/>Everyone ate in an orderly and quiet manner, no one daring to speak a word. It was the Old Granny’s rule that one did not speak when having a meal, and that one did not chatter before going to bed.<br/><br/>Unlike Fang Xingjian, who was only level 9, Old Granny had long reached the divine level, level 30. She no longer had high requirements for the food she partook in, and only took a few symbolic bites before stopping. Looking at her little grandson[1], who had oil all over his mouth because of the food, she smiled, picked up a napkin, and wiped off the oil stains from his mouth. She looked very amiable then, entirely different from her previous cold-as-ice look.<br/><br/>“Eat slowly. One must look proper when having a meal.”<br/><br/>The four-year-old Fang Xingchen had been instilled with the various rules and regulations of great clans from an early age, unlike a commoner family’s child. He looked like a small adult, sitting up straight, picking his own food, each movement prim and proper.<br/><br/>If one could say that the Old Granny doted on third uncle and his family the most, disliked second aunt, and detested second uncle for his uselessness, then towards her grandchild Fang Xingjian, for reasons unknown to him, she felt hatred.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian was conscious of this, which was also why he stayed quietly in his corner, eating only from the dishes placed in front of him, and not standing up to reach for the dishes placed further away from him.<br/><br/>About twenty minutes later, everyone had almost eaten their fill. The maids cleared away the dishes and brought in a big pot of soup. The moment they saw this soup, regardless of whether it was second uncle and aunt, or third uncle and aunt, their expressions showed excited expectation.<br/><br/>The soup stock was made from an extremely vicious animal by the name of Nine-Headed Abyss Bird, its level having been over 25. The military had sent their forces to the Other World to hunt it and bring it back to Demonic City. Multiple alchemists had then worked together to create this Nine Blood Spirit-Changing Soup, with the heart of the Nine-Headed Abyss Bird as the main ingredient, complemented by eighty-one different precious herbs.<br/><br/>The soup not only filled one’s stomach, it also had the effects of refining muscles and bones, replenishing vital energy and blood, cleansing impurities, and improving one’s constitution, therefore significantly hastening one’s training progress.<br/><br/>Even with the financial powers of the Fang Clan, each person could only afford to drink a very small bowl at lunch every day.<br/><br/>After the maids served the soup, everyone drank it up in haste.<br/><br/>“Xingchen, granny will give her share to you.” The Old Granny seemed a lot happier watching her grandchild drink the soup in big gulps rather than drinking it herself.<br/><br/>The four-year-old Fang Xingchen was very polite, and said, “One bowl is enough for me. Granny is always busy handling important tasks and is the pillar of our Fang Clan. It would be better for Granny to take this bowl of Nine Blood Spirit-Changing Soup instead.”<br/><br/>The Old Granny smiled and said, “It’s alright. It has no effect on me, regardless of whether or not I drink it. Right now your body is still developing, you can have it.”<br/><br/>“Thank you for the gift, Granny.” Fang Xingchen raised his small hands and received the bowl of soup respectfully.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Fang Xingjian was, obviously, the last person to be served with the soup. Peering at the mysterious soup in his bowl, which looked as if it had the soul of a tiger, his throat trembled uncontrollably.<br/><br/>This bowl of soup would be able to provide his Qi, blood, veins and muscles with a great number of nutritious supplements. It was also the benefit of having been born in a big clan.<br/><br/>He quickly finished the whole bowl of Nine Blood Spirit-Changing Soup, feeling its warmth spread throughout his body as if a pleasant current was traveling through it and refining it. Fang Xingjian took a whiff of the soup, wishing that he could have more than one bowl as he glanced jealously at Fang Xingchen.<br/><br/>However, he knew that it was hopeless for him to be envious of the love that the Old Granny had for Fang Xingchen.<br/><br/>Once all the food had been finished, the servants cleared the cutlery and started to serve tea and snacks. Everyone knew that it was time for the Old Granny to discuss family issues with them, or to check on the progress of their assignments.<br/><br/>After taking a sip of tea, the Old Granny spoke out. “Have there been any problems with the daily necessities we have at home, recently?”<br/><br/>Second aunt immediately stood up. She had always been the one to supervise the daily necessities and accounting of the whole family. She said, “There’s enough. Mother, do you want to take a look at the accounting records?”<br/><br/>“Mmm, it’s good enough if they’re sufficient. I won’t look at the records.” The Old Granny considered second aunt’s expression and asked “What other issues do you have?”<br/><br/>Second aunt proudly said, “Mother, Yuehe (second uncle) has been training hard recently, and has finally reached level 19. He is already preparing for the second job transition.”<br/><br/>Based on the current research conducted by humans, starting from level 1, a person’s level could rise until one reached level 30. However, when on the verge of leveling up from level 9 to level 10, from level 19 to level 20, and from level 29 to level 30, there was an obstacle requiring one to go through a job transition before he or she could continue leveling up.<br/><br/>The Other World had a set of natural methods to successfully get through job transitions, passed down from long ago. While people on Earth had not inherited these methods, through the research of scientists from all over the world and with help from some of the forces in the Other World, a way to go through job transitions by extracting the essence of ferocious beasts and using it to draw magic prints on the human body had been invented.<br/><br/>Starting from the first job transition, up to the second job transition, and all the way to the third job transition, when one leveled up from level 29 to level 30, people could gain extraordinary strength and could also gain progress within the job type they chose with each job transition.<br/><br/>For example, before they went through the first job transition, at level 9 or lower, most people would only be able to attain a 1 point increase in an attribute of their own selection.<br/><br/>After the first job transition, from level 9 and all the way up to level 19, even the trashiest job would give a 1 point increase in strength, a 1 point increase in agility, as well as a 1 point increase in an area of one’s own choice.<br/><br/>The more powerful the job one transited to, the more extraordinary the gained strength would be, and the higher the points required for each increase in job progression level. It was already hard enough for one to win over an opponent who was a level higher, and it was essentially impossible to win over one who was two levels higher, but one would be crushed by an opponent three levels higher than oneself.<br/><br/>Of course, there were exceptions, namely people who had exceptional talent. Even if they were no match for their opponents in terms of level, they would still be able to challenge opponents of higher levels by learning stronger techniques, and by gaining more exceptional specialties.<br/><br/>Attributes, techniques, specialties. These were the three major factors which determined one’s combat powers.<br/><br/>Hearing second aunt’s words, and seeing the look of complacency on her face, third aunt sneered to herself and interrupted, “Oh, second brother will be going through the second job transition so soon? It couldn’t be that all of his experience was gained from killing monsters, could it?”<br/><br/>Leveling up required experience, and there were three ways to gain experience. Firstly, to kill ferocious monsters or humans; secondly, to study and learn; and lastly, to train one’s skills or physique.<br/><br/>To other people, killing monsters was an extremely difficult task. However, a big clan such as the Fang Clan had the ability to purchase dying ferocious animals in bulk, just in order to kill them. Thus they would be able to level up quickly.<br/><br/>This way of leveling up, though, would tend to make one inferior to other people of the same level. If one did not rely on learning, training and upgrading their skills, one would not have as many attributes, techniques, and specialties as others.<br/><br/>It was also something which Fang Clan’s Old Granny detested.<br/><br/>On hearing third aunt’s words, second aunt frowned, and anger rose within her. But, seeing the Old Granny frowning, she immediately explained, “That’s not true! Yuehe (second uncle) has been putting a lot of effort in his training! I got my eldest brother to especially give him some pointers in the path of the sword, and he has shown great improvement, and has now reached level 19.”<br/><br/>The Old Granny nodded when she heard this. “I have also heard much of Zhan Xiandao’s (second aunt’s elder brother) renowned name. Son, it’s a rare opportunity. You’ll have to learn from him.”<br/><br/>“I understand.”<br/><br/>Seeing how submissive he was, the Old Granny said, satisfied, “You are my son, and Fang Clan’s Second Master. Since you will be going through the second job transition soon, the clan will definitely have to help you. What are your plans?”<br/><br/>Very carefully, second uncle said, “I plan to choose between Blood Abyss Sovereign and Heavenly Disaster Medium.”<br/><br/>“Mmm, they both sound good. But both of them would require quite the expenditure,” said the Old Granny. “Later on I’ll get someone to transfer you fifty million. You can choose the magic print required for the job transition yourself.”<br/><br/>Hearing this, both second aunt and uncle were surprised and quickly gave their thanks. Third uncle did not seem to mind, but third aunt’s countenance looked gloomy and unhappy.<br/><br/>Second aunt looked at third aunt proudly, then suddenly asked, “Oh, right. Sister, third brother has been leaving early and returning home late daily. He must have been training very hard as well. And with the two masters hired by mother herself, he must be showing progress and is sure to reach the second job transition soon, right?”<br/><br/>Third aunt obviously knew her husband well. Even if her mother-in-law invited instructors from the military, this fellow would still be worthless. Forget about training, she had to be thankful if he did not visit the casino every night!<br/><br/>He was merely at level 14, despite turning thirty soon.<br/><br/>Hearing the other party’s words, third aunt could only smile bitterly and say, “Not yet. How could it be so soon? Yueming (third uncle) plans to focus on strengthening his techniques first…”<br/><br/>Following that, the Old Granny brought up some other issues, respectively testing second and third uncles’ progress, and giving them feedback. Second aunt felt superior, looking boastful, while third aunt was overcome with exasperation and rage, hating her husband for his uselessness.<br/><br/>[1] Referring to Fang Xingchen

Chapter 3 Talent<br/><br/>At the very end, the Old Granny clapped her hands. Seeing that she was the focus of everyone’s looks, her face broke into a proud smile.<br/><br/>Those who knew the Old Granny well would be able to tell that she probably had an announcement to make, and one which pleased her at that.<br/><br/>The Old Granny tried to hold in her smile as she said, “Xingchen’s test results are out.”<br/><br/>The jobs that humans could choose were divided into two big categories. One of them was the most common Warrior job, which was available to everyone.<br/><br/>The other one, Mage, was only for those with psychokinesis abilities. Generally, only one in ten thousand would meet the requirements for becoming a Mage.<br/><br/>If one was to state the difference between the Mage and the Warrior, it would be as vast as the difference between a Warrior who had already undergone the second job transition and one who had undergone the first job transition; or a Warrior who had gone through the third job transition and one who had only gone through the second job transition. The Mage was akin to a killing machine, born to be above all living creatures.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian, naturally, had gone through the same test long ago, when he had been young. It was too bad that he did not have the necessary talent to become a Mage.<br/><br/>Hearing that Fang Xingchen’s test results were out, and looking at the Old Granny’s expression, everyone was feeling circumspect.<br/><br/>The Mage proficiency examination ran a detailed test on the subject’s mental status, physical status, aptitude in psychokinesis and many other factors. The results of the test would obviously decide whether the subject had the potential to become a Mage or not.<br/><br/>Following everyone’s gaze, the Old Granny smiled as she looked at Fang Xingchen and said, “Seems that there’s going to be a Mage in our Fang Clan. The results of the test state that Xingchen has the aptitude to become a Red Robed Mage.”<br/><br/>“How… How is that possible?” Seeing this, second aunt’s face turned extremely pale. She knew that there was no way she would have the same standing as third aunt anymore.<br/><br/>Third aunt cried out, “Hahahaha, Red Robed! The talent to become a Red Robed Mage! My son is a Red Robed Mage!”<br/><br/>“Mage?” After being stunned for a while, third uncle said in a daze, “My son has the talent to become a Mage? My son is going to be a Mage! I am going to be the father of a Mage! Hahahahaha!”<br/><br/>The Old Granny looked at the dazed Fang Xingchen, who did not know what to do, then she smiled and said, “Xingchen, Granny has already registered you with the Mage Association. You’ll have to work hard to pick up Mage skills in the future.”<br/><br/>The whole scene was a mess, with gazes ranging from envy and jealousy to excitement, all directed towards Fang Xingchen. All of it made him the absolute star of the moment.<br/><br/>A look of yearning hung on Fang Xingjian’s face, but it eventually faded away, as he headed out of the hall.<br/><br/>“Young Master has the talent to become a Mage!”<br/><br/>“Did you hear? The tests showed that Young Master has the aptitude to become a Mage!”<br/><br/>“Is that the truth? Seems like our Fang Clan will finally have the chance to shine again, amongst the Five Great Clans.”<br/><br/>Walking along the long corridor, Fang Xingjian kept hearing the servants’ chattering. In but a moment, the news of Fang Xingchen having the talent to be a Mage had spread throughout the whole mansion.<br/><br/>There were also those who smirked when seeing Fang Xingjian.<br/><br/>The Old Granny had always doted on Fang Xingchen. Now that his aptitude to become a Mage had been revealed, Fang Xingjian, to whom the Old Granny had not taken a liking, would now lead a life even worse than usual.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian was feeling a very complicated swirl of contrary emotions. Although he felt happy that his younger brother had the talent to become a Mage, and happy for the prosperity that the Fang Clan would gain with this, he also felt a mixture of bitterness, jealousy, and envy.<br/><br/>‘Why… Why was I not the one with the talent?<br/><br/>‘If I were the talented one, then grandmother would like me too, right?’<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian, in a stupor, unknowingly walked into a bamboo forest courtyard. He could no longer see any servants in the vicinity as if he had entered another world altogether.<br/><br/>Soon after, he heard a lament.<br/><br/>“Ten~~years, ~~ dead~~and~~living~~dim~~and~~draw~~apart~~”[1]<br/><br/>Hearing the lament, Fang Xingjian felt a surging feeling of loneliness and chilliness in his heart, as if all of his blood was going to freeze, and his life would forever turn dim and gloomy.<br/><br/>However, he was someone who had attained full experience for level 9 after all, and he was going to undertake the first job transition any time now. Given his developed physical attribute, he reacted right away and turned his head towards the direction of the strange lament. He saw a man in black standing ten meters away from him.<br/><br/>The man in black seemed very blurry, and the spot where he was standing seemed to be shrouded in a layer of black mist as if he was an envoy from hell.<br/><br/>“Who are you? How dare you break into the Fang Residence?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian immediately realized that the other party was not a character who a low-level Warrior not even past his first job transition could deal with. This was why he had hollered, in a bid to alert the other people in the mansion.<br/><br/>Who would have thought that right after he said that, the man in black would turn and point towards him? In the next moment, purple flames started leaping towards Fang Xingjian. Then he only felt the flaring purple flames engulfing him, as he cried out in agony.<br/><br/>“Argh!!”<br/><br/>“Young Master, Young Master?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian opened his eyes and noticed a servant standing in front of him and calling him.<br/><br/>The bamboo forest was still in front of his eyes, but there was no man in black in the courtyard. It was as if everything that happened had been an illusion.<br/><br/>He looked at the servant in front of him and asked, “Did you see that man in black? Did you see purple flames?”<br/><br/>“What man in black and purple flames? Young Master, you’ve only been standing here all along.” The servant was stunned for a moment as he looked at him in astonishment, then said, “Old Ancestress has asked me to summon you to the ancestral hall.”<br/><br/>‘Illusion?’ Fang Xingjian shook his head, still unable to figure out what had just happened. He could only put it aside for now.<br/><br/>He replied, “Grandmother asked me to go to the ancestral hall? Got it, I’ll go right now.”<br/><br/>Then, he headed for the ancestral hall, unaware of a small purple tattoo which had appeared at the bottom of the back of his neck.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian lowered his head and entered the ancestral hall respectfully. The Old Granny was already standing in the middle of the ancestral hall, her gaze at the memorial tablets.<br/><br/>When the rich gained fame, they would tend to come up with things like pedigree and ancestral halls. Obviously, the Fang Clan was no different.<br/><br/>For the past few generations, all deceased members of the Fang Clan were immortalized in ancestral halls. The ashes of the clan’s ancestors were in the adjacent crematorial hall, where Fang Xingjian’s mother’s remains were also stored.<br/><br/>A complicated expression on her face, the Old Granny Li Shuanghua gazed at the tablet inscribed with the name Fang Yueru (Fang Xingjian’s mother).<br/><br/>Hearing Fang Xingjian’s footsteps, she did not turn around, but said, “You will be going through the first job transition soon?”<br/><br/>“Yes, I have reached level 9 for over a month now.”<br/><br/>The Old Granny nodded and said, “Where do you plan to go next?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian obediently replied, “I plan to enroll in the top Blue Mountain Academy.”<br/><br/>The Blue Mountain Academy was a school for Warriors led by the military. It especially nurtured outstanding young Warriors among the humans.<br/><br/>The Old Granny suddenly said, “You have not yet prepared the magic prints for your first job transition, have you? I’ll get someone to transfer you one million later, you can purchase ferocious beasts from the market to hasten the job transition.”<br/><br/>Hearing the Old Granny’s words, Fang Xingjian was so surprised that he could not believe what he had just heard. In Demonic City, the job transition process was based on magic prints, and magic prints required the extracted essences of ferocious beasts from the Other World.<br/><br/>All this while, Fang Xingjian had been struggling to find a way to lay his hands on ferocious beasts, but he certainly had not expected that his grandmother, who did not pay him any heed, would actually help him.<br/><br/>However, before the feeling of surprise had even faded, the Old Granny continued, “You won’t need to go to Blue Mountain Academy. I have contacted the Mage Association for Xingchen. After you’ve gone through the first job transition, you will accompany him to the Mage Academy.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingchen was stunned. “Mage Academy?”<br/><br/>“Before a Mage goes through the first transition, he is much weaker. It’s just ideal that you brothers would work together. I want you to be his apostle. You’re the elder brother and you will have to take good care of him in the Mage Academy…”<br/><br/>Fang Xingchen was no longer listening to what the Old Granny was saying. The word ‘apostle’ was still echoing in his mind.<br/><br/>‘A Mage’s apostle’ was a nice way of putting it. There was another name for it – the Mage’s ‘Slave’. It was a kind of dark magic through which Mages bound another life to their own. A Mage’s Slave would have to abide by the words of the one who performed the spell for eternity, and any damage inflicted upon the Mage could be transferred to the Mage’s Slave.<br/><br/>However, the requirements for being a Mage’s Slave were very tough to fulfill. Not only was one required to have good physical and intellectual abilities, the person also had to be someone who was related by blood. Fang Xingjian and Fang Xingchen were a good example.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian had put in a lot of effort and he had worked hard for many years only to end up as a stepping stone for Fang Xingchen, only to contribute to his cousin’s strength.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian laughed bitterly, saying, “Grandmother, you’ve never shown me any concern since I was a child. The year I turned six, when I fainted from fever and almost died, it was second uncle who sent me to the hospital. You didn’t even take a look at me!<br/><br/>“All these years, my monthly spending money have been reduced by second aunt, and I have been forced by third aunt to do all sorts of daily chores. I’ve put up with all these while you turned a blind eye to what was going on!<br/><br/>“Now that Xingchen has the talent to become a Mage, I am happy as well. But to think that you would want me to be his Mage Slave?!<br/><br/>“Grandmother, there’s only one thing I want to ask. Do you really see me as your grandson?”<br/><br/>“Bastard!” The Old Granny landed a slap on Fang Xingjian’s face, and looking at his stubborn gaze, she angrily asked, “Is this the way you talk to your elders?”<br/><br/>“If you treated me as your grandchild, I would naturally treat you as my elder! If you don’t even treat me like a human, it’s no wonder I wouldn’t respect you as an elder!” Looking at the Old Granny, Fang Xingjian resolutely declared, “I will definitely go to the Blue Mountain Academy. Even if Xingchen is my younger brother, I will not give up my life for him.”<br/><br/>“Haha!” the Old Granny laughed out in fury. “Since when were you the one to make decisions in this family?”<br/><br/>“When youngsters don’t know their place, it is only natural that the elders would make the decision in their stead. Your life? From the moment you were born, you’ve belonged to our Fang Clan. You grew up eating food from our Fang Clan. If it wasn’t for me, you would have long died of starvation in the streets! What life would you have now?”<br/><br/>“I will not go!” Fang Xingjian strongly objected. “Even if I were to die, I will not become a Mage’s Slave.”<br/><br/>Hmph!<br/><br/>With a cold snort, the Old Granny’s palm swung out, sending a strong hurricane towards Fang Xingjian. The force of a suffocating pressure landed on him, making him drop to his knees.<br/><br/>“Your life was given by me. You will live as a member of the Fang Clan, and when you die you will stay a ghost of the Fang Clan. You haven’t got the luxury to think about all this rubbish.”<br/><br/>“Xingchen is now the hope of our family, and you will be his shadow, protecting him for life, even if you have to die for him!”<br/><br/>“No one should have to die for another!” Fang Xingjian hollered. “Since you want me to become a Mage’s Slave, it seems that you do not see me as your grandchild. Therefore, from today onwards, I forsake you as my grandmother!”<br/><br/>“Hahahaha!” The Old Granny was so infuriated that her face turned pale, and a ray of cold light shot up from her eyes, seeming to freeze the space around them. She turned to look at the memorial tablet behind her and said, in anger, “Fang Yueru, take a good look! This is the bastard son that you have given birth to! He doesn’t know any shame, and even refuses to acknowledge his family, just like you back then!”<br/><br/>“Stop saying bad stuff about my mother!” Fang Xingjian’s face turned red, and all his muscles started to tremble as he struggled to stand up.<br/><br/>But… the godly prowess of one who was at level 30 was not something he could withstand. He heard the Old Granny give a cold snort, and with the outburst of strong pressure she applied, he was pressed down to the ground and lost consciousness.<br/><br/>The Old Granny Li Shuanghua laughed coldly and headed out of the ancestral hall. Tens of Warriors in black clothes and armor kneeled before her.<br/><br/>They had formed through a secret job for the first job transition, passed down within the Fang Clan. The Old Granny Li Shuanghua was the only one who knew the contents of the magic prints. They were named Black-Crystal Armored Soldiers, and along with their first job transition, each of them would get a +3 increase in the strength attribute, a +2 increase in the agility attribute, and a +4 increase in the endurance attribute.<br/><br/>They were all wearing alloy armors weighing more than two hundred kilograms, equipped with high-frequency long sabers manufactured by the military, and the latest magnetic rifles. Each of them was like a human tank, and together they represented Fang Clan’s most powerful elite troops.<br/><br/>“Keep your eyes on him. Don’t let him out.”<br/><br/>“Yes.”<br/><br/>[1] A poem written by Su Shi, also known as Su Dungpo, a Chinese writer, poet, painter, calligrapher, pharmacologist, gastronome, and statesman of the Song dynasty.

Chapter 4 Escape<br/><br/>A few hours later, Fang Xingjian had gradually regained consciousness, and realised that he was still in the ancestral hall. Recollections of his conversation with Li Shuanghua came back to him, his eyes filling with bitterness.<br/><br/>He wanted to leave the hall, but his path was automatically cut by the Black-Crystal Armored Soldiers. After looking around, Fang Xingjian realised that the soldiers had fully surrounded the ancestral hall.<br/><br/>Knowing that there was no way he could force his way out, he decided to sit down and contemplate, trying to come up with a solution.<br/><br/>‘Based on grandmother’s stubborn character, she’s bound to go through with whatever she says. If I don’t think up a way to escape, I will become Fang Xingchen’s Mage Slave for the rest of my life. This is definitely not the life I want.<br/><br/>‘But… how do I escape?<br/><br/>‘These Black-Crystal Armored Knights have been nurtured by the Fang Clan since young. Although they don’t know many techniques or have any specialities, their experience is all gained from killing monsters. In addition to the growth rate of their job, their strength, agility and endurance attributes are all above 30 points.’<br/><br/>With more than 30 points in strength, agility and endurance, one could easily flip a huge elephant, tear apart tanks or be able to treat iron rods as if they were soft towels, all without even breaking a sweat. How could the Fang Xingjian now charge through in this situation?<br/><br/>‘What should I do?’<br/><br/>After contemplating for about an hour, Fang Xingjian was still clueless. However, in that very moment, sounds of conversation drifted to him from outside.<br/><br/>“You guys can leave, mother wants me to persuade him.”<br/><br/>“But Her Excellency said…”<br/><br/>“Huh? You don’t believe me? Or are you saying that I don’t have the power to suppress him?”<br/><br/>“Your subordinate wouldn’t dare.”<br/><br/>The rattling of armours resounded as the Black-Crystal Armor Knights gradually retreated.<br/><br/>After a while, the gate opened, and second uncle slowly strolled in.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian stared at his second uncle in astonishment as he asked, “Second uncle, are you here to persuade me?”<br/><br/>“Haa…” second uncle sighed. “Come with me.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian bewilderedly followed his second uncle, noticing that there was no one else around. In the blink of an eye, they arrived at the back gate of the Fang Clan residence.<br/><br/>“Mother wants you to become Xingchen’s apostle, but I don’t agree with it. However, she has already decided on it, and I’m incapable of changing her mind.” Second uncle shook his head, as he lightly stated, “Go on, leave. Go to the Miracle World (this was what ordinary earthlings called the Other World). Run as far as you can, and don’t ever come back here again.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian’s eyes reddened as he looked at second uncle in front of him. It was as though second uncle had turned back to the man he was before being married.<br/><br/>“Uncle…”<br/><br/>“This unregistered card has two million on it. Hold on to this. It’s a secret stash of money which I’ve accumulated over the years. If your aunt finds out about it, I’m finished.” Second uncle sighed once more. “These past few years, I haven’t really taken good care of you. You don’t belong here with the Fang Clan. Go and search for your own path. Don’t stay in Demonic City any longer. If you do, mother will send men to capture you.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian accepted the card and replied in a low voice, “Uncle, thank you.”<br/><br/>Second uncle didn’t reply, as he stared straight at Fang Xingjian’s face, before mumbling to himself, “The resemblance, so alike…”<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“You really resemble your mother.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian got emotional all of a sudden. He stared at his second uncle and asked him, “Second uncle, why… why does grandmother hate me so much? What have I done wrong? How did my mother really die? And who is my father?? Why does grandmother fly into a rage whenever I ask about it?”<br/><br/>In one breath, he blurted out all the questions that had been troubling him and which he had kept within his heart ever since he was little.<br/><br/>“The matter of eldest sister… I can’t explain it clearly either. If you really want to know, wait until you break through into the Divine Realm before asking mother again.” All of a sudden, the courtyard was filled with a cacophony of noises. Second uncle nervously added, “Go quickly, they are coming in this direction. I’ll draw their attention away.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian turned back to look at Fang Residence for one last time before he swiftly ran outside in the darkness.<br/><br/>‘I will definitely come back here one day!’<br/><br/>‘Grandmother, I will prove you wrong. I’m more talented than any others. I’m the true hope of our Fang Clan!’<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>In the train station, Fang Xingjian looked at the staff member behind the counter and inquired, “It still isn’t working?”<br/><br/>The member of staff inclined his head as he studied Fang Xingjian’s features intently, comparing them to the photograph, and replied, “My apologies, we ran into some trouble with the machine, please wait a little longer.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian glanced suspiciously at the staff member. At the same time he took in his surroundings, only to discover that numerous sturdy, muscular men were subtly approaching him from all directions.<br/><br/>“Damn.” He immediately sprinted away explosively. With 9 points in both his strength and agility attributes, Fang Xingjian’s movements were as ferocious as a mad ox’s.<br/><br/>“He’s escaping!”<br/><br/>“Catch him!”<br/><br/>“Don’t shoot!”<br/><br/>Initially, the muscular men had been advancing slowly, but seeing Fang Xingjian’s actions they immediately reacted and rushed to surround him.<br/><br/>After evading them for a long time, Fang Xingjian finally lost his pursuers, all thanks to his higher stats when compared to normal humans.<br/><br/>Leaning against the wall, he breathed heavily, ‘Even the airport has been sealed? Have they made use of government relations?’ He knew that the Fang Clan was very influential. It was extremely simple for them to put his name on the wanted list, thus barring him from all methods of transportation.<br/><br/>‘If that’s the case, then there’s no way for me to cross over to the Miracle World through government-controlled transport systems…’<br/><br/>The Miracle World was connected to Earth, and the point of connection between the two was located within Demonic City. However, the connection was not a tunnel, or a door, or a bridge, but a region which was actually common territory between the two. This region encompassed a huge stretch of land and sea. One could travel there via car, boat, or even by foot.<br/><br/>Because of this, the territory had been jointly sealed by the various countries. If an ordinary human wanted to go there, they would first have to go through many stages of approval from the countries’ governments before gaining access.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian had actually prepared the relevant documents long ago, leaving a lifeline for himself. But who would have expected that the Fang Clan would issue orders to suppress him? Not only that, but as long as any of his actions indicated that he wanted to enter the Miracle World, those from the upper echelons of the government would immediately send their men to pursue and capture him.<br/><br/>“Since this is the case, I can only try to sneak in…”<br/><br/>A few of the major countries wanted full control over the access to the common region. This naturally led to other countries or powerful groups being unsatisfied with the situation, which in turn led to illegal entry.<br/><br/>After all, the region was at the intersection between the two worlds, so its internal structure was extremely complex and dangerous. There were many places that even the army had no power to seal.<br/><br/>‘If that’s the case, I’m afraid my mobile has already been tracked and it might even be leading them to my position.’<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian intentionally left his mobile phone on the bus before getting off, after which he walked to a nearby public phone booth and began dialing.<br/><br/>Du…du…du…<br/><br/>“Hi?” a crisp female voice answered.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian replied, “It’s me.”<br/><br/>The other party’s voice grew heavy as she continued, “What happened? I feel as though the whole city is chasing after you.”<br/><br/>This was a girl which Fang Xingjian had met during the times when was learning sword arts from the dojo, and who had gradually become Fang Xingjian’s best friend.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian asked, “Has the news already been spread to the city bureau?”<br/><br/>The girl inclined her head as she contemplated the looks of her flustered police colleagues. Walking out, she stated, “We’ve received orders from up top to capture you. What have you done, exactly?”<br/><br/>“Li Shuanghua wanted me to become a Mage’s Slave. So I’ve decided to leave the clan.”<br/><br/>The female police officer, Jessica, drew in a sharp breath before asking, “What do you want me to do?”<br/><br/>“I want to go to the Miracle World. I know you have a way.”<br/><br/>“Tonight, midnight, meet me at the old rendez-vous point.”

Chapter 5 Capture<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian hid in a dark corner beside a multileveled public housing, checking out the quiet streets.<br/><br/>A woman over 1.8 metres in height with bright golden hair and a long pair of legs was standing in the street.<br/><br/>As the overlapping point with the Miracle World, Demonic City was divided between five major countries. The policemen, the firemen, the city government and other such things were jointly managed by the forces of many countries, which meant that the forces included both white-skinned and black-skinned policemen.<br/><br/>‘All clear.’<br/><br/>With a pair of binoculars, Fang Xingjian looked towards Jessica, who was standing in the street, and only headed towards her after half an hour had passed.<br/><br/>“No one followed you?”<br/><br/>“Of course. No one knows that I’m on such good terms with you.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian asked, “The Five Great Clans have their own hidden means of travelling to the Miracle World. I was hoping to use the Medici Clan’s means.”<br/><br/>The pretty blonde before him was a member of a branch family in one of the Five Great Clans, the Medici Clan. Her situation was similar to Fang Xingjian’s. Although she had been born in a big clan, she was not highly valued.<br/><br/>Hearing Fang Xingjian’s words, Jessica frowned and asked, “How much money do you have with you?”<br/><br/>“My account has been frozen. The money that I’ve got on hand right now amounts to about two million,” Fang Xingjian replied.<br/><br/>“That should be about enough,” Jessica nodded. “I will add one million to that. There’s a ship tomorrow night, so you can take the sea route to the Miracle World.”<br/><br/>Slightly hesitant, Fang Xingjian said, “There are many ferocious beasts along the sea route, as well as tsunamis caused by interdimensional storms. Wouldn’t it be too dangerous?”<br/><br/>“If it wasn’t such a dangerous route, how would you even have the chance to take it?” Jessica turned away and said, “Come along. First, you can spend the night at my place. They shouldn’t have discovered our relationship.”<br/><br/>A few minutes later, Fang Xingjian and Jessica headed off in a small car, and the two of them soon arrived to a high-storeyed apartment building. Fang Xingjian followed Jessica to her flat. When she opened the door, he could see over ten empty wine bottles on the table, and many unwashed dishes and empty containers of cup noodles in the kitchen sink.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian said, helplessly, “Can’t you tidy up a bit?”<br/><br/>Jessica kicked off her sports shoes, she lay down on the sofa, casually grabbed a packet of half-eaten chips and said, “You should be glad to have a place to stay, stop being so picky about the details. Want some?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian rolled his eyes and moved the undergarments, brassieres and such on the other sofa before sitting down. Suddenly, he felt something hard under his butt. He reached out to grab it, and found himself holding a long vibrator in his hands.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian rolled his eyes at Jessica again. “How long has it been since someone last came to your house?”<br/><br/>Jessica blushed, quickly snatching away the vibrator from Fang Xingjian’s hands, and mumbled, “I am a single lady in my prime, at the age of twenty. Can’t I indulge in a bit of healthy stress relief?”<br/><br/>She nonchalantly threw the vibrator into her room and came out only in her underwear. “I’m going to take a shower, you can find some food for yourself.”<br/><br/>With the open display of her figure and her lovely-shaped thighs moving around in front him, Fang Xingjian could not help taking a few looks.<br/><br/>Jessica entered the bathroom, but suddenly popped her head out again, smiling and said, “Hey, we don’t know when you’ll be coming back after you head for Miracle World tomorrow. Shall we have a round of sex for memory’s sake? You’re still a virgin, right?”<br/><br/>“Scram!” Fang Xingjian grabbed a tissue box by his side and threw it at her, as she laughed out loud and dodged into the bathroom.<br/><br/>“This woman… She is probably a virgin herself…. No… She tore it by herself.” Fang Xingjian shook his head helplessly and sighed as he lay back into the sofa.<br/><br/>The events of the past few days kept going round in his head. His grandmother’s viciousness, Xingchen’s talent, second uncle’s helplessness, and his mother’s photo. The scenes kept flashing in his mind until he eventually fell asleep.<br/><br/>“What do you wish for?”<br/><br/>Amidst the darkness, Fang Xingjian opened his eyes as he heard a familiar voice.<br/><br/>“Who are you? Where is this place?”<br/><br/>In the darkness, the other party seemed to not have heard his questions and merely asked, “What do you wish for?” At the same time, a purple flame flickered in the darkness.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian looked at the purple flames in astonishment. The next moment, the voice asked again, “What do you wish for?”<br/><br/>Soon after, the purple light flared up, and the darkness in the surroundings dissipated. The place was all covered in purple flames and surprise was reflected in Fang Xingjian’s eyes.<br/><br/>The next thing he knew, he was sitting up on the sofa, his forehead and neck drenched in sweat.<br/><br/>The sound of pouring water was coming from the kitchen. Jessica said, “You’re awake! I saw that you fell asleep on the sofa last night and decided not to wake you up.”<br/><br/>She brought out a cup of coffee, looked at Fang Xingjian, who was sweating profusely, and curiously asked, “Not feeling well?”<br/><br/>“It’s nothing. I had a nightmare.”<br/><br/>“Alright, I have to go to work. You can stay here today. Take care. There’s food in the fridge if you’re hungry!”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian stayed at Jessica’s place the whole day, and even tried to check for news online. However, it was obvious that all official channels would not have any news on him.<br/><br/>Although he was a bit concerned because of his dream the previous night, as well as the illusion he had seen in the bamboo forest, he did not manage to find anything useful even after having done some online research.<br/><br/>Midnight came by quickly, and Fang Xingjian boarded Jessica’s car to arrive at a pier.<br/><br/>Lights flashed in the darkness surrounding the pier, from a fishing boat quietly sitting anchored by the bank.<br/><br/>“This?” Fang Xingjian asked.<br/><br/>“Mmm, I’ve already made all the arrangements. You can board it,” Jessica said.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian turned to look at the pretty blonde beside him and said, “Thank you.”<br/><br/>Jessica smiled, but then sternly replied, “I’ve checked. Fang Xingchen has the talent to become a mage, and under your clan’s Old Granny’s arrangements, he could be taken in as a disciple by the Mage King. It’s best if you don’t ever come back.”<br/><br/>Hearing this, Fang Xingjian immediately clenched his fists.<br/><br/>The Mage King was one of the few in Miracle World who had reached level 30, and was a mage who had divine powers.<br/><br/>A level 30 Divine Mage and a level 30 Divine Warrior were not of the same grade, based on the information which he had learned so far. The difference between them was more like a nuclear bomb and and a fuel-air explosive. One was a tactical weapon, while the other was an ordinary bomb.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian’s clenched fists gradually turned white, as he said in a low voice, “I’ll be back.” After saying this, he stepped out of the car and left.<br/><br/>Jessica shook her head and looked at Fang Xingjian’s back as he left. Walking alone in the dark alley, it was as if he would be devoured by the darkness in the next moment.<br/><br/>A tinge of pity flashed in her eyes, and she opened her mouth as if wanting to say something. But eventually, the would have been words ended up in a sigh.<br/><br/>On the other end, Fang Xingjian walked to the fishing boat and noticed a black man standing at the bow, staring at him. The black man’s gaze was sharp as a knife, scanning him as if he were merchandise.<br/><br/>“Fang Xingjian?”<br/><br/>Immediately sensing that something was off, Fang Xingjian frowned. “How does he know my name?”<br/><br/>In the next moment, he heard the sound of blowing wind, and a killing aura swiftly encompassed him. Fang Xingjian attempted to move and wanted to dodge, but the other person’s attack was much faster, and more than ten sword Qi slashed through the air towards him.<br/><br/>These sword Qi were strong waves formed by slashing sharp swords through the air, as layers of air particles moved extremely quickly.<br/><br/>The speed of the sword Qi was very fast, and their impact was not too weak either.<br/><br/>While Fang Xingjian was struggling to move, he received a few slashes from some of the sword Qi on his legs and chest. His flesh was cut open, and the wounds increased, gradually dying his clothes red.<br/><br/>The immense pain and his split flesh made him shudder as several narrow swords were placed at his neck.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian saw over ten people surrounding him, each of them black-skinned men dressed in black, as if they were ninjas. Coldly, he said, “Gale Storm Controllers? You’re from the Onassis Clan?”<br/><br/>The Onassis Clan was the only black-skinned clan amongst the Five Great Clans, and the Gale Storm Controller was the characteristic secret job type passed down within the Onassis Clan. Out of all the job types of the first job transition, it could easily rank in the top thirty of the strongest job types to go through. It was also a job type for which only the Onassis Clan knew the magic prints.<br/><br/>The previous sword Qi, or better yet, the air shockwave or even vacuum slash, was the unique prowess and special job skill of the Gale Storm Controller.<br/><br/>“Haha,” a melodious laughter echoed and a bald black lady walked out. Her smooth skin was close to the color of wheat. Together with her skin tone, her slender neck and sharp chin exuded a feminine charm.<br/><br/>Caroline Onassis from the Onassis Clan took a long look at Fang Xingjian before she said, “Take him away.”<br/><br/>With a bang, Fang Xinjian felt a sharp pain at the back of his neck and fell unconscious.

Chapter 6 Torture<br/><br/>Under the blue skies and white clouds there lay a vast and endless ocean.<br/><br/>The fishing boat drifted slowly, and Caroline Onassis was overcome with boredom as she looked at the report in her hands.<br/><br/>“Has that old woman shown any signs of reaction?”<br/><br/>A burly black man in front of her replied, “I’m afraid it is as rumored. Li Shuanghua did not care about this grandchild.”<br/><br/>“Tsk, I knew it. How could a cold-blooded old woman like Li Shuanghua give up the chance to get close to the Mage King for the sake of a grandchild she hates?” Caroline shook her head and said, “What else did those old geezers say? When can I return?”<br/><br/>“It’ll be another week. After this one week, regardless of whether Li Shuanghua takes action or not, we’ll need to get rid of that chap.”<br/><br/>“One week?!” Caroline shouted. “You want me to stay in this dratted place with no network, handphone or television for one week?!”<br/><br/>Cold sweat broke out on the burly man’s forehead as he answered softly, “This the Elder Council’s decision…”<br/><br/>“A bunch of idiots, old farts, good-for-nothings, crappy…” Caroline shouted, “Who was it that came up with such lousy idea? That cute little sister of mine?! Or that uncle of mine whose head is filled with pig’s intestines?”<br/><br/>No one replied. When Caroline was like a crazy roaring lioness, no one dared to reply.<br/><br/>Caroline spat, looking at the trembling burly man in front of her, and suddenly asked, “Is that chap awake?”<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>In the black nothingness, a purple flame was flashing in the distance.<br/><br/>“What do you wish for?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian shouted loudly, “Who are you?”<br/><br/>The voice ignored him and continued to say, “What do you wish for?”<br/><br/>“I want power. Power to make me invincible! Are you able to give me that?”<br/><br/>“What do you wish for?”<br/><br/>“Tsk.” Fang Xingjian shook his head. He had been dreaming the purple flames daily, but the other party would not show any reactions regardless of what he replied, and instead just kept asking him what he wished for.<br/><br/>The next moment, icy cold seawater was poured all over his body.<br/><br/>Intense pain came from his right arm.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian gradually opened his eyes.<br/><br/>A black lady was looking at him with a brutal gaze, similar to a tiger assessing its prey.<br/><br/>“Hahahaha, Fang Xingjian, you’re awake?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian looked at his right arm, which kept sending signals of intense pain. When he saw the empty spot where his little finger had been, and the layer of bandages wrapped over it, a tinge of savageness flashed in his eyes. His little finger had been cut off.<br/><br/>“There was no other choice. We needed something to show your grandmother our sincerity.” Caroline walked to stand in front of Fang Xingjian, touched his face and said, “It’s too bad that that old woman really doesn’t like you.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian stared at her and asked, “Who are you? What do you want?”<br/><br/>Caroline gave a weird laugh and said, “I am Caroline Onassis. As for why we’re looking for you, it’s very simple. The Black Mage King is looking for a disciple, but there are currently two candidates. One of them is Fang Xingchen, while the other one is Doris Onassis.<br/><br/>“And that old fart is only willing to take in one disciple.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian looked coldly at Caroline and said, “You guys want to use me to threaten Li Shuanghua? I can’t help but say that this is a really bad move.”<br/><br/>“Hahahaha.” Caroline smiled and said, “You’re right, this was a really bad move. We’ve sent her a letter along with your finger, but she hasn’t shown any reactions as of yet.<br/><br/>“However, this is merely one move out of the many blows we’re planning. For the next week, your Fang Clan’s business, territory and members will all be receiving all sorts of blows. That old woman won’t be able to hang on.”<br/><br/>“I guess it’s just too bad for me, huh?” Fang Xingjian smiled bitterly. “You guys are not just planning to snatch the position of the Black Mage King’s disciple, but you also want to force the Fang Clan down from their position as one of the Five Great Clans?”<br/><br/>“Hehe, the Fang Clan’s abilities have long been unfit to be considered on par with ours, and yet they are still hogging so many businesses which they cannot hold on to. This is not good. It’s not only the other great clans, there’s also quite a number of multinational companies and political groups that have their eyes set on the Fang Clan.<br/><br/>“We’re the first to take action, but we’ll definitely not be the last.” Caroline’s finger stroked past Fang Xingjian’s shoulders as she asked, “Make a guess. Will I kill you?”<br/><br/>Between her words, the area where her fingers passed by felt sore, as if a blade had been there, and had torn off a huge chunk of flesh off Fang Xingjian’s shoulder.<br/><br/>A terrible cry escaped from Fang Xingjian’s mouth as he glared at Caroline and he coldly said, “You lunatic.”<br/><br/>“Hahahahaha.” Licking the blood on her fingers, she laughed loudly and said, “In the midst of these boring seas, I have to find some entertainment for myself.”<br/><br/>Caroline put her hands together, and suddenly the air in the room changed. Countless streams of air started rubbing against each other, creating a loud rumbling, as if ten thousand horses were stampeding, or as if a waterfall was flowing backwards.<br/><br/>‘A large-scale air shockwave?’ Fang Xingjian focused his gaze. ‘Is this the Onassis Clan’s second job transition, the Grand Air Controller?’<br/><br/>Caroline revealed a perverse sense of excitement as she looked at Fang Xingjian and shouted, “If you’re in pain, you must cry out. You must definitely cry out, ok?”<br/><br/>In the next moment, the many streams of air turned into blade Qi, consecutively rubbing against each other, and releasing a sharp sound before they all shot out towards Fang Xingjian.<br/><br/>In a moment, Fang Xingjian felt as if he was being dismembered, as if tens of thousands of small, sharp blades were drilling through him at the same time.<br/><br/>Endless sounds of puchi puchi echoed through the air, as fresh blood started filling the atmosphere, as if it were a faint layer of mist dispersing in the air.<br/><br/>Caroline let the blood splash on her, dying her clothes and skin in the color of red.<br/><br/>“Scream out, cry out, enjoy yourself!”<br/><br/>A twisted sense of satisfaction hung on her face, and her vision started to blur.<br/><br/>“My dear sister, do you think you can stand above me after you have become the Black Mage King’s disciple?<br/><br/>“I will not let you leave.<br/><br/>“No one can think of escaping from me!”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian’s expression was twisted, his mouth open as he kept on shouting with terrible screams.<br/><br/>“Haha, guess how much we spent to buy your friend over?<br/><br/>“The lady’s name is Jessica, right?<br/><br/>“Five million USD was all it took for her to agree to bring you here.<br/><br/>“You’re really unpopular.”<br/><br/>As she wantonly left one scar after another on Fang Xingjian’s body, Caroline’s voice was like the cry of a demoness, echoing in Fang Xingjian’s ears.<br/><br/>“Haha, Fang Xingjian, you’ve never found out how your mother died, right?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian raised his bloodied head and glared at Caroline with a wild beast’s gaze, as if he wanted to swallow her whole.<br/><br/>“Hahaha, right, right, right, this is the expression.<br/><br/>Do you think that your second uncle released you for your own good?<br/><br/>You’re so naive. He wanted to dispose of his nephew’s Mage Slave, to pave his way when he would fight to become the head of the clan in the future.”<br/><br/>Caroline smiled and shouted loudly, “And your mother, hahahaha! She was a genius who had gone through the second job transition at the mere age of 16! How could she possibly have died due to birth complications? Allow me to tell you. Your mother was beaten to death by your grandmother.<br/><br/>“Hehehe, did you know? Your life was destined to be a tragedy from the day you were born.”<br/><br/>“Impossible!” Fang Xingjian shouted in fury. “I don’t believe this! Right. Demonic City was only created 16 years ago. My mother was only 16 years old then. How could she have gone through the second job transition? You’re lying!”<br/><br/>“Haha, do you really think that humans only started going to Miracle World 16 years ago?”<br/><br/>Caroline was obviously experienced in torturing others. Each blow she dealt to Fang Xingjian gave him the most pain, but the least injury, making him drown in endless pain without the relief of fainting or death.<br/><br/>The most terrifying thing was her words. They were like poisonous daggers, each cutting deep lines into Fang Xingjian’s heart. She kept torturing his mind endlessly from all angles, from his birth and life to his mother and friend.<br/><br/>Two hours later, Caroline stopped, breathless. Her face was still red from excitement as she threw Fang Xingjian a last glance before she headed outside.<br/><br/>At the same time, she instructed, “Heal him. We’ll continue tomorrow.”<br/><br/>“Wait a moment!” Fang Xingjian lifted his head. No part of his body seemed to be intact, as if he was an overused, old, ragged toy. He struggled to lift up his head, and asked Caroline, “How did my mother die?”<br/><br/>“Hahahaha, I’ve already told you the answer. What can I do if you won’t believe it?”<br/><br/>During the next seven days, Fang Xingjian suffered from Caroline’s inhumane torture. In the beginning, he would still try to talk back, he would still scream out. But during the last few days, he had already lost all of his strength, and did not even have enough energy to speak.<br/><br/>A few black-skinned men brought up the battered Fang Xingjian to the deck. Caroline looked at Fang Xingjian, who now had a lifeless gaze and showed no reaction, and she shook her head, saying, “How boring.<br/><br/>“Throw him into the sea.”<br/><br/>A black guard by her side said, “My lady, should we chop off his head before tossing him down?”<br/><br/>“Idiot! We’ve come all the way from the Eastern Sea. This is the Miracle World. Do you think he can still survive in this state?” Caroline asked. “The nearest coast from here is at least 200 kilometers away.<br/><br/>“Moreover, in a situation where he can’t even move an inch, wouldn’t it be more beautiful to have him see himself slowly slapped around by the currents, eaten by the fish, and lastly dying in solitude and despair?”<br/><br/>The black men in the surroundings all trembled in a cold shiver, looking pitifully at Fang Xingjian before once again lifting him up.<br/><br/>With a splash, Fang Xingjian was tossed directly into the seas.<br/><br/>Caroline smiled. “Alright, then. We can finally return to Earth!”<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Drifting in the sea, tremors of immense pain rocked Fang Xingjian’s body.<br/><br/>He felt as if he had been cut into pieces, then tossed into a mixer and blended crazily in it. When he breathed in air once again, the fishy smell of the sea entered his lungs.<br/><br/>But Fang Xingjian did not care about it in the least. His mind was swallowed by a dark, bottomless pit of despair, and an endlessly burning fury was scorching his heart.<br/><br/>‘I can’t take this lying down… I can’t take this lying down.<br/><br/>“Caroline Onassis, that b*tch!”<br/><br/>Faces passed through his mind, names flashed in front of his eyes. The immense pain of his body was in no way comparable to the pain in his heart. Fang Xingjian was getting weaker and weaker, but despite that, he was thoroughly drowning in vengeance and fury.<br/><br/>‘Why is it me? Why – is – it – meee?!!’<br/><br/>Accompanying the explosion of thoughts of vengeance, fury, despair and many other dark emotions, the tattoo of the purple flames on Fang Xingjian’s neck became increasingly defined.<br/><br/>In the next moment, with a bang, the purple flames started to flare up from the back of his head, encompassing his whole body, and immediately turning him into a man in flames.<br/><br/>But although the flames were burning, when they came into contact with the sea water, they made no reaction, as if they were illusions.<br/><br/>‘Am I going to die?’<br/><br/>The expected scorching pain from being burned by the flames did not come. However, there was a numb and itching feeling extending all over Fang Xingjian’s body. He felt as if his wounds were being stabilized and… and that he would no longer die.<br/><br/>‘What is this?’ Looking at the purple flames on himself, a tinge of surprise passed through Fang Xingjian’s eyes.<br/><br/>Under the burn of the purple flames, the wounds on his body gradually healed. Even the little finger which had been cut off was quickly regenerating, growing out at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Chapter 7 Choice <br/><br/>Just as Fang Xiangjian was wondering what the flames in front of him were, a massive amount of information was transmitted to his brain from the flames.<br/><br/>It was neither words nor pictures, but more of a direct ‘understanding’, filling up his mind in a moment, making him understand what the purple flames before him were.<br/><br/>If you give up something, you will gain something in return. Make a wish, and if you can give up something of sufficient value, you can obtain everything you want in this world.<br/><br/>There were almost no redundant thoughts. Heavily injured all over his body, Fang Xingjian who had drowned in despair hollered his own wish straight at the flames.<br/><br/>“Power! Give me great power! A power strong enough to eradicate the whole of the Onassis Clan!”<br/><br/>In the next moment, an evil wholly encompassed Fang Xingjian. And then it was as if he could hear his own voice ringing out in his mind. Something was speaking in his voice.<br/><br/>“You can’t afford the price for this.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian frowned and he immediately recalled that he had almost nothing on him. How would he have items to exchange for power?<br/><br/>He asked, “Then what can I get? What can I afford? What can you give me? Something that can allow me to destroy the whole Onassis Clan!”<br/><br/>There was no reply, but an option appeared before Fang Xingjian, and it was the only option.<br/><br/>“Obtaining the topmost degree of sword arts talent in the world requires giving up 72 years of lifespan, which leaves you with only five more years of your life. At the same time, you will never be able to feel love, kinship, and friendship, and you’ll end up leading a lonely life until your death, unable to procreate, or to have any descendants.<br/><br/>“From now onwards, everything related to happiness in the human world shall no longer be of your concern. Are you willing to accept this?” Fang Xingjian’s voice resounded in his own head.<br/><br/>“Hahahahaha!”<br/><br/>Without any hesitation, Fang Xingjian broke into a smile, “I couldn’t ask for anything better.”<br/><br/>In the next second, an inhumane pain fell upon him from the heavens, and Fang Xingjian could only feel how every single bone in his body and every inch of skin was being torn apart, pulverized and melted.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian had completely lost consciousness as soon as it had begun, but the changes to his body did not stop. The purple flames soared into the skies, transforming his body, mind, and brain towards a unique direction.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian’s brows trembled as he slowly regained consciousness. He immediately felt that his whole body was still cramping with waves of immense pain, his broken bones and injured organs rendering him immobile.<br/><br/>However, a medicinal smell came to his nose.<br/><br/>“Wuliwala, waliwula…” An old man turned over to look at Fang Xingjian, who was lying on a bed.<br/><br/>He spoke a lot, but Fang Xingjian could not understand any of it. However, he did not say much himself. He only stared towards the ceiling, as if he was no longer concerned with everything before him.<br/><br/>‘I’m not dead? Did I get picked up by someone?’<br/><br/>‘That flame, was it an illusion?’<br/><br/>‘But in this state, what can I do even if I survived?’<br/><br/>Despair, unresigned and emotions of fury kept surging in Fang Xingjian’s mind. But the next moment, disbelief flashed in his eyes.<br/><br/> Name	 Fang Xingjian<br/> Age	 16<br/> Occupation	 Warrior’s Squire<br/> Level	 9<br/> Strength	 9 (3)<br/> Agility	 9 (3)<br/> Reaction	 6 (3)<br/> Endurance	 6 (2)<br/> Flexibility	 6 (2)<br/><br/>The numbers listed in the brackets were Fang Xingjian’s attributes in his injured state, which now made him incomparable to an ordinary person. If not for the fact that the purple flames had retained the last bit of his life, he would have died through and through.<br/><br/>But this was not what he was surprised by. What felt different to him were his techniques.<br/><br/> Basic Sword Technique	 Level 3<br/> Single-handed Sword Grab	 Level 2<br/> Cross-slash	 Level 2<br/><br/>There was no change to the level, but the experience required to raise the level of the Basic Sword Technique from level 3 to 4 had turned into 0/1.<br/><br/>The experience required to raise the Single-handed Sword Grab from level 2 to 3 was 0/1.<br/><br/>Similarly, the experience required to raise the level of the Cross-Slash was also 0/1.<br/><br/>‘How could this be? I only require 1 point of experience to increase my level? How could this have happened?’<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian stared at this sight, flabbergasted. But he soon recovered.<br/><br/>‘The topmost degree of sword arts talent in the world ? This is the topmost degree of sword arts talent in the world ?’<br/><br/>“Hahahahahahaha!” He started to laugh fanatically, to the extent that tears were pouring out from the corners of his eyes. The old man who was at the side stood up and came to his side, shouting out wuliwala as if he could not understand anything at all.<br/><br/>But Fang Xingjian did not care about this. All he could think of was practicing his sword techniques. He wanted to wave his sword, wanted to see if his sword techniques would level up.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Three days later, the bedridden Fang Xingjian struggled to sit up. He seemed to have no parts of his body which was not in pain, both inside and out, but he slowly raised his arms, putting his fingers together to form a sword.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian felt a surge of power coming up from the lower half of his body. It was the explosion of power coming from the muscles, and passing through each section of the muscles in his waist, spine, shoulders and elbows, swelling at the joints, and changing into a sharp piercing power as he released it from his fingers.<br/><br/>With a single thrust of his fingers as a sword, Fang Xingjian’s heart swelled with a feeling of everything having turned clear. His actions were as familiar to him as taking a breath, making him feel as if he had practiced this thrust for thousands or even tens of thousands of times.<br/><br/>But at the next moment, he screamed out in pain and fell to the ground by the bedside, the pain in his body instantly magnifying ten times. He had overexerted himself, and had torn his wounds open again.<br/><br/>The old man came in and immediately started gabbling away when he saw him.<br/><br/>But Fang Xingjian was full of smiles, all his concentration focused on the Techniques Column.<br/><br/>Basic Sword Technique level 4, experience required to level up was 0/2. With merely just a thrust of his fingers acting as a sword, he had managed to level up.<br/><br/>The days passed by. While he was resting on the bed, Fang Xingjian did not waste his time. He tried to learn the language the old man spoke, and was soon able to achieve basic communication with him.<br/><br/>The old man seemed to be an ordinary fisherman, and was very poor. The medicine applied on Fang Xingjian was what he had mixed up together himself, made from medicinal herbs he had gathered, together with fish meat and blood.<br/><br/>Based on Fang Xingjian’s observation and inference, the injuries on his body had not been left behind by Caroline. Those wounds seemed to have been healed by the purple flames. Instead, his body seemed to have suffered from huge injuries when he had been given the talent in sword arts.<br/><br/>It might have been because Fang Xingjian originally had astonishing physical attributes; or because he had a strong desire to live; or that the medicine was effective; or maybe because of something which the purple flames had done; but what was certain was that the injuries on his body were slowly recovering.<br/><br/>And after every few days, he would not be able to hold it in, and waved around with his hands and legs to practice his sword skills in an attempt to gain a general understanding of his current talent.<br/><br/>Even a normal wave of his hands and legs could increase the proficiency of his Basic Sword Technique. However, it was not the same for the Single-handed Sword Grab and the Cross-slash.<br/><br/>He had already attained level 10 for the Basic Sword Technique, with experience 3/20. Passing through each level required only very little experience, which was obviously due to the effects of the attributes given by the purple flames.<br/><br/>This meant that he had a type of unique comprehension of the sword which allowed him to hasten the speed at which he gained experience. Even waving his limbs around allowed him to gain experience. The Basic Sword Technique, which usually required one to put in much effort and go through tough training, now seemed very simple. Only a pitiful amount of experience was required in order to level up his techniques.<br/><br/>Now that his Basic Sword Technique had reached level 10, he had additional gains. Other than the increase in the speed and accuracy of the thrusts, he had also gained 1 point in both his strength and agility attributes. This was an additional increment in attribute after attaining level 10 of the Basic Sword Technique, something which Fang Xingjian had known about long ago.<br/><br/>In fact, most techniques would have additional increments to his attributes after reaching level 10, which was also the maximum level for ordinary people.<br/><br/>And most Warriors who were trained in sword arts would be able to raise this technique to level 10, therefore obtaining the additional 1 point increase to their strength and agility.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian now felt that he had advanced immensely in terms of both speed and accuracy of his sword thrusts. When going through the various sword moves, he felt that all the elements of his body were highly coordinated, as if his muscles had all joined into one.<br/><br/>This was a level which an ordinary person would only be able to attain after training for many years.

Chapter 8 Speedy Improvement<br/><br/>Rumble~~~~~<br/><br/>The air resounded with an incessant tearing sound, and crackling sounds came from the walls. It was the sound of air being squeezed together and then slammed against the walls.<br/><br/>The sound of wind and thunder rang out as if a thunderstorm would soon appear in the room.<br/><br/>“You rascal, are you going crazy again? Are you thinking of smashing everything in the house?” The old man angrily walked in. He saw Fang Xingjian sitting on the bed, creating a series of afterimages with the wooden rod in his hand. It was as if over ten wooden rods were being thrust out at once, not only one.<br/><br/>The afterimages disappeared the next moment. Fang Xingjian started coughing furiously, so much so that traces of blood were dripping off the corners of his lips.<br/><br/>The old man took the wooden rod away from his hands, and looked at Fang Xingjian, who was coughing non-stop. Helplessly, he said, “I told you not to move around recklessly. Do you want to die?! Do you know how seriously hurt you are?!”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian replied in the Common language, which he had not mastered yet, “…I don’t have much time left.”<br/><br/>The Common language was the most widely used language in the Miracle World. In fact, Fang Xingjian had taken it up before, whilst in Demonic City. It was just that, in the beginning, the old man’s accent had been too heavy for him to figure out.<br/><br/>Later on, after realizing that this was actually the Common language and that he was in the Miracle World, he started pestering the old man to chat with him daily. Thus, he managed to increase his proficiency in the Common language by leaps and bounds.<br/><br/>This was because he really did not have much time left.<br/><br/>Indeed, since the purple flames had already bestowed the sword arts talent upon him, then it was obvious that, just as promised, his lifespan would have also been taken away from him.<br/><br/>Now, Fang Xingjian had been left with a lifespan of merely five years. If he were to seek revenge, five years would be very little time for the many things he had to do.<br/><br/>He not only wished to take revenge, but he also wanted to kill Caroline and eradicate the Onassis Clan.<br/><br/>He also wanted to return to Demonic City, travel back to the Fang Clan, and outrightly ask Li Shuanghua about the way his mother had died.<br/><br/>And all of these required power.<br/><br/>He took a look at his stats in the Techniques Column. Although he had only gotten up for a brief practice everyday, his Basic Sword Technique had already risen to level 20 with 0/500 experience, a level unprecedented in history!<br/><br/>A level 20 Basic Sword Technique. An ordinary person’s Basic Sword Technique could be raised to around level 10 at maximum, and only a few talented geniuses would be able to break through this restriction and reach level 12, 13, or even level 15. But Fang Xingjian had never even heard of, let alone seen before, someone with a level 20 Basic Sword Technique.<br/><br/>This had all been achieved after his talent had changed for the better.<br/><br/>Having reached level 20 in the Basic Sword Technique, his sword thrusts had also increased in speed and accuracy. Furthermore, his attributes had also increased: 1 point in strength, 2 points in agility, 1 point in reaction, and 1 point in flexibility. It was the equivalent of having risen five levels!<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Another ten days or so passed. Fang Xingjian walked out stumbling into the courtyard. With a raise of his arm, countless beams of black light instantly appeared as if they were black pythons, pouncing forth and tearing across the air. The black lights had swiftly appeared and then disappeared, leaving behind only shrieks in the air.<br/><br/>With a slight tap of his feet, he dashed towards the earth wall, and the branch in his hand once again turned into a fiery black python. He thrust towards the wall ahead of him in a graceful arc.<br/><br/>From the bottom of his feet to his lower thighs, upper thighs, chest, shoulders, and elbows, all the collected energy condensed into a ball as his muscles and bones made rattling sounds. Fang Xingjian felt as if he had turned into a sharp sword as he thrust, releasing all the energy from his body in an instant.<br/><br/>The speed from the instantaneous explosion caused a series of sharp howls in the air. Eventually, the branch knocked against the earth wall, producing a loud, explosive boom and creating a small fist-sized hole in the wall.<br/><br/>A level 25 Basic Sword Technique made the attack speed of Fang Xingjian’s sword over two times faster than before. He could display astonishing power even if he was merely holding on to a tree branch.<br/><br/>However, the instantaneous explosion made it much more difficult for him to breathe. After all, he could only just manage to stand up, and the wounds on his body had not ameliorated.<br/><br/>But even so, Fang Xingjian raised his arm once again, planning to practice his sword swings.<br/><br/>He had no time left.<br/><br/>Therefore, along with the gradual recovery of his wounds, his training became more challenging and more frequent.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>One month later, Fang Xingjian was practicing the Basic Sword Technique. However, he did not simply practice a single stance, but instead he practiced the whole set of twelve basic sword moves. These included the following: split, chop, burst, stir, cut, brush, intercept, stab, agitate, push, parry, and wave.<br/><br/>They were the basic techniques which one could easily learn from a dojo or school back in Demonic City.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian meticulously continued his practice, going through the various basic stances and training the simplest moves of the Basic Sword Technique.<br/><br/>A minute later, the Basic Sword Technique leveled up once again, reaching the unprecedented level 30 in the history of its existence.<br/><br/>In that moment, Fang Xingjian also felt that he had reached the limit of the Basic Sword Technique, and that it was no longer possible to level it up any further. Checking his Techniques Column, he saw that it was just as he thought. There were no other experience requirements after achieving level 30 in the Basic Sword Technique. This meant that he had already reached the maximum level.<br/><br/>The increase in attributes from training the Basic Sword Technique included 2 points in strength, 3 points in agility, 1 point in reaction, and 1 point in flexibility.<br/><br/>Other than that, he had also gained his first specialty.<br/><br/>Specialty Genius Swordsmanship: an almost perfect mastery of each basic stance, allowing the individual to be able to master any sword technique with exceptional speed.<br/><br/>It was obviously a passive skill increasing the speed of learning swordsmanship. Fang Xingjian already had the aptitude to learn quickly. With this specialty, he wondered how much faster it would be now.<br/><br/>A satisfied smile broke out on Fang Xingjian’s face, and the wooden sword in his hands once again formed a series of afterimages, as if a beam of cross-shaped starlight flashed through the air, leaving a cross-shaped mark where it had struck the ground.<br/><br/>The ‘brush’ and ‘split’ sword movements were connected, and one would almost not be able to see any loopholes between the two. The cross on the ground was so deep that it seemed to have been created by blades or axes, and not at all by a wooden sword.<br/><br/>At level 20, the Cross-slash had also reached its maximum level and could no longer progress. At level 10, the Cross-slash had brought an additional 1 point increase in agility and a 1 point increase in flexibility.<br/><br/>At its current 20th level, the gains were an increase of 1 point in strength, 2 points in agility, and 2 points in flexibility.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian revealed a carefree smile. He had been practicing swordsmanship for over ten years, but this was the first time he had felt so good. His swordsmanship was progressing at a speed which could almost be seen by the naked eye. His techniques were leveling up almost daily.<br/><br/>In a mere one to two months’ time, despite having spent most of it lying in bed, his swordsmanship was almost equivalent to one who had been training his swordsmanship for over ten years.<br/><br/>Seeing himself gradually getting stronger and stronger, the feeling of contentment was simply intoxicating.<br/><br/>But even so, he still continued with his training. Although constantly practicing the Basic Sword Technique and Cross-slash no longer had any effect, he was actually practicing for his third technique, the Single-handed Sword Grab.<br/><br/>His Single-handed Sword Grab had already reached level 19 and was close to leveling up once again.<br/><br/>Having reached level 10 in the Single-handed Sword Grab, due to the increase in skill mastery, Fang Xingjian had also gained a 1 point increase in strength and a 1 point increase in agility apart from the increase in dealt damage.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian repetitively practiced a series of basic stances in the courtyard. Although it did not look good, the endless booms of thunder which echoed when the wooden sword sliced through the air made one feel as if each sword move contained extreme power and speed.<br/><br/>With the Genius Swordsmanship specialty, Fang Xingjian felt as if he had become one with the sword in his hands. Each movement, each strand of strength, and each constriction of the muscles felt as natural as breathing to him.<br/><br/>Finally, Fang Xingjian’s fierce movements stopped, and a smile of satisfaction shone on his ice-cold face.<br/><br/>He had reached level 20 for the Single-handed Sword Grab, which included an additional attribute increase of 2 points in strength, 2 points in agility, and 1 point in flexibility.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian’s overall attributes had changed to:<br/><br/> Name	 Fang Xingjian<br/> Age	 16<br/> Occupation	 Warrior’s Squire<br/> Level	 9<br/> Strength	 14<br/> Agility	 16<br/> Reaction	 7<br/> Endurance	 6<br/> Flexibility	 10<br/><br/>Within one to two months’ time, it was as if Fang Xingjian had achieved a qualitative improvement, but he had yet to fully master the Single-handed Sword Grab.<br/><br/>However, in his current state, there was no way for him to compare against the massive Onassis Clan. Even so, the training during the past months had raised his confidence immensely.<br/><br/>‘Now, I only require sufficient sword techniques to be able to endlessly continue my training.<br/><br/>‘If the technique’s maximum level is high, then the training speed will also be many times faster than that of an ordinary person.<br/><br/>‘A hundred techniques, a thousand techniques… So long as I practice enough sword techniques, my power will continue to grow limitlessly.<br/><br/>‘The only thing left to do is to look for more sword techniques.’<br/><br/>An ice-cold killing aura flashed past Fang Xingjian’s eyes. It was as if black flames were burning in his eyes.<br/><br/>‘Onassis… and Caroline. I won’t let you wait for long.’

Chapter 9 Struggle<br/><br/>Seeking revenge would require immense power.<br/><br/>For Fang Xingjian, the optimal way to obtain tremendous power was studying sword arts.<br/><br/>And he had already thought of a way to study it in the Miracle World.<br/><br/>In this world, one’s personal growth in the martial arts domain far surpassed that of the people on Earth. Even the strongest of the current Five Great Clans in Demonic City had relied on an enormous amount of resources from the Other World get to where they were.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian must have been brought to the Miracle World by sea after he had been kidnapped by Caroline. The time that he spent on his recovery had not been wasted. He had pried information regarding this world from the old man, and found that most of it confirmed what he had previously learned in Demonic City.<br/><br/>In this world, one was accustomed to levels, attributes and techniques. These were thought to be as natural as the sky, the sun, or gravity.<br/><br/>Although he had heard rumors about the Other World many times back in Demonic City, it was Fang Xingjian’s first time actually being here.<br/><br/>According to the old man, they were currently on a colossal continent, near the western coastline of Sinkoda, which was the biggest of the six countries on this continent.<br/><br/>‘However, according to the internal government of Demonic City, out of the six countries Earth is only in contact with Uranlis. The remaining five are unfamiliar with Earth to such an extent that they are probably unaware that Uranlis has already teamed up with forces from another world.’<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian thought to himself, ‘This seems to be congruent with what I’ve fished out from the old man. Ordinary people are clueless that their world is slowly being invaded by outsiders.<br/><br/>‘The only question is, how deep the alliance between Uranlis and Earth actually is…’<br/><br/>“Hey.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian turned around to see the old man regarding him indifferently. He was holding a sword covered in dust, stains, and grease. It looked much like a poker for the fireplace. One which had been lying in the house for a very long time.<br/><br/>As Fang Xingjian turned around, the old man flung the longsword at him.<br/><br/>Clang!<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian unsheathed the sword. It lacked luster and did not exude a sinister chill. It was simply a common western single-handed sword, about 1.2 meters in length and three fingers in width. The blade was marked by nicks left behind by countless battles.<br/><br/>“You rascal! How dare you train everyday with such serious injuries? Are you thinking of going back for revenge? To have left you in such a terrible state… It couldn’t have been an easy opponent.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian did not reply to the old man’s question.<br/><br/>Shaking his head, the old man said, “This is a sword I’ve kept from my days in the army. Take it. I have no use for it.”<br/><br/>“Thank you.” Fang Xingjian sincerely looked at the old man.<br/><br/>With that, he sheathed the longsword and walked towards the door.<br/><br/>“Where are you planning to go?”<br/><br/>“North, to Kirst. I hear that there are many institutions there training warriors and teaching skills,” replied Fang Xingjian. It was the nearest big city to the fishing village. He was planning on looking for opportunities, gathering information, and finding places where he could learn sword arts.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian believed that in a world where one possessed attributes, skills, and the ability to gain strength through training, there would certainly be communities similar to clans or unions, where the strongest were nurtured.<br/><br/>“Kirst is far, and the path leading to it dangerous. It’s almost winter. Even large contingents of warriors might not safely survive a journey full of blizzards and ravenous wild beasts. Aren’t you afraid of dying halfway?”<br/><br/>“I’d go even if I were to die on the way,” Fang Xingjian paused to explain. He added, “There isn’t much time left for me.” Indeed, if the will in the purple flames had not been lying, he only had about five years left to live.<br/><br/>He was running out of time.<br/><br/>The old man stayed silent for a while. Then, he said, “When you arrive in Kirst, if you’re not dead and if you’re still keen on learning sword arts, you can go to The School of Sword Arts.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian looked back and noticed the old man’s brown eyes staring vacantly, as if he were immersed in a memory.<br/><br/>The old man rubbed his eyes and waved, “Go on, go on, do what you have to.”<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Even though everyone had the possibility to become the strong, perhaps because of how strong individuals were in general, progress in civilization was slow on the mainland.<br/><br/>Countless villages and towns were still in a profound state of ignorance. Most people were still deeply entrenched in manual labor, similar to Europe in the Middle Ages.<br/><br/>Furthermore, since the people here were mostly at level 5 and above, the majority of the commoners had become the main driving force of common labor. Some were still using horses as their main mode of transportation.<br/><br/>“Hurry up, hurry up! We have to reach the next camp by night!” yelled the blonde-haired green-eyed chief in charge of the trade caravans.<br/><br/>Amidst the trade caravans, Fang Xingjian carried a sword at his waist and almost 200 jin of goods on his back, advancing alongside the group.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Late into the night, Fang Xingjian grit his teeth and tore into the stone-hard black bread. Staring at the bonfire, his eyes seemed to have burning flames in them.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>In the middle of the storm, carriages were being swept off the cliff. Agitated, the chiefs hurried the laborers and slaves, having no other choice but to join them in their efforts.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian was thoroughly drenched from the storm. As he marched along the muddy mountain road, the rain was biting cold. The goods were becoming increasingly heavy as they soaked up the rain, yet his back stayed straight.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>“Here’s your pay.” A satchel of coins was flung at Fang Xingjian. “You really won’t consider joining us to Filain? It’ll be snowing soon, and the road to Kirst won’t be smooth.”<br/><br/>“Thank you.” Fang Xingjian took the satchel and turned around to leave.<br/><br/>“You insolent fellow, the chief is talking to you!” A large man with brown hair stood up, only to be set back by the chief. He looked at the leader in confusion, “Chief?”<br/><br/>He did not understand why the chief had stopped him from teaching that arrogant prick a lesson. That prick did not have superior strength, and he clearly had not yet passed his first job transition. He would at most be a level 9 commoner.<br/><br/>The chief shook his head without a word, a grave look on his face as he constantly gazed at the rugged longsword at the youngster’s waist.<br/><br/>Braving the mighty wind and snow, Fang Xingjian trudged northward, shrinking against the stinging frosty rain and against the ice-cold temperatures that made his skin turn purple. He wrapped himself tightly with a fur coat, protecting every inch of his skin from the snowstorm.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Under the starry sky, Fang Xingjian hid in a small pit he had dug. The bonfire beside him was growing weaker, as if it would sputter out at any moment. He shook uncontrollably, as though shaking could prevent his body heat from escaping, but his eyes were filled with the raging flames of revenge.<br/><br/>“Caroline… Onassis…<br/><br/>“Wait for me…”<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian sprinted, leapt, and drew his sword from his waist in the blink of an eye. Drops of searing blood trickled down the blade and splattered on the snowfield, leaving a long crimson trail.<br/><br/>Tens of large wolves howled savagely and sinisterly in fury, chasing at Fang Xingjian’s heels. The smallest of the pack was more than four meters long, and all of these wolves looked like armoured cannonballs, tearing the air apart as they ran, and baying sharp thunderous howls.<br/><br/>In this digitized world, human beings were not the only ones who could become stronger. There were many strong, monstrous beasts as well.<br/><br/>These monsters were known as ferocious beasts, and they evolved from wild beasts which had levelled up by killing.<br/><br/>These countless ferocious beasts roamed the forests, grasslands, and rivers. Every year, there would be many people who travelled into the wilderness only to fall prey to these beasts.<br/><br/>This world had never belonged solely to Man. Most of those without formidable skills would never pass the first job transition and would probably never even leave their hometowns in their whole lives.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian leapt into the flowing currents with a splash. The bitter-cold water nearly froze his body.<br/><br/>Looking back at the large wolves, he saw that they had paused at the waterbank, hesitating. After running alongside the river for another few hundred meters, they gradually gave up the chase.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian finally found a chance to climb up the bank after drifting for two kilometers. He took off his clothes right away and started looking for flint in order to start a fire.<br/><br/>He stood by the bonfire, jumping continuously, swinging his sword, and exercising. His eyes shone with a beastly glint.<br/><br/>‘I will survive!<br/><br/>‘Not just survive, but become stronger, stronger and stronger!’<br/><br/>Be it storm, snow, or the loneliest night, Fang Xingjian never fell. He straightened his spine, eyes glimmering faintly like a wolf’s.<br/><br/>He kept recalling that night in the ancestral hall, the days he was on the seas to the Miracle World. The images kept replaying in his mind, making his heart colder and colder and making the fire in his eyes blaze more aggressively with each moment.<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>A man stood in front of Kirst’s city gate. His clothes were torn and tattered, and his hair was long and tangled. He had the appearance of a refugee from the dirtiest, lowest slums.<br/><br/>His lips were chapped, and his face was pale, green, and gaunt, as if he had suffered from famine. Only his eyes still shone like stars in the night sky.<br/><br/>‘I’m finally here.’<br/><br/>‘Kirst.’<br/><br/>This man was, naturally, Fang Xingjian. He lowered his head to look at his Specialties Window. It now had an added specialty.<br/><br/>Beginner’s Survival Instinct: evolved endurance and willpower; allows you to ignore pain and tolerate hunger; all non-fatal injuries will not bother you in your battles and struggles.

Chapter 10 The School of Sword Arts<br/><br/>On the western side of Kirst, Torch Tavern in the commoner district was bustling with activity.<br/><br/>The smell of cheap tobacco and alcohol along with the stench of sweat from a few or more than ten days’ worth of not bathing drifted in the air. As the liveliest tavern in the commoner district, it was full of various gangsters, hippies, and the lowest of the laborers, alcoholics, gamblers, and prostitutes…<br/><br/>“Have you heard? Fei Yang Knight Academy is recruiting, and I’m planning on trying out.”<br/><br/>“Haha, you? I remember you only managed to learn your foundation skills after five years.”<br/><br/>“Have you heard? Traces of demons were found north of Uranlis.”<br/><br/>“Huh, was this made up by those blasphemers again?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian absorbed bits of information one after another. This was his third day in Kirst, and he already had a general idea of the city’s affairs based on what he had acquired so far.<br/><br/>One of the largest cities on the west coastline of Sinkoda, Kirst, was a massive ocean trading-port, as well as one of the political and economic centers of the west coast.<br/><br/>It was common to see black-haired and black-eyed men like him here. It was said that on the other side of the ocean, the Western Land, most people had features like Fang Xingjian.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Fang Xingjian knew that they were not Earthen descendants, despite their Asian features.<br/><br/>Being a political and economic center as well as a trading port, Kirst was especially prosperous. As a matter of fact, there were myriad organizations providing opportunities to learn and advance martial skills.<br/><br/>This was a world where skill advancement, techniques, specialties, and attributes were part of everyday life. Everyone, from young to old, had qualities far surpassing those of earthlings.<br/><br/>Leveling up and becoming stronger was a way of life. Each individual hoped to change his or her life by building up their strength.<br/><br/>In Kirst, other than the common Warrior academies, Martial Art academies, Dojos and others, there were the seven most famous academies in the city, collectively known as the Seven Pearl Academies.<br/><br/>The ‘Pearl’ part of the name referred to Kirst, the pearl of the Empire’s west coast.<br/><br/>According to the information Fang Xingjian had acquired, two of the Seven Pearl Academies were well-known for their swordsmanship, namely The School of Sword Arts and Tresia Knight Academy.<br/><br/>Dave Tresia, the founder of Tresia Knight Academy, had achieved level 30 more than a hundred years ago, and he had groomed batches and batches of prominent aces, generals, and experts. Although Tresia Knight Academy had fallen behind in recent years, it was still within the top three of the Seven Pearl Academies.<br/><br/>The School of Sword Arts, however, paled in comparison.<br/><br/>The academy in Kirst was only a secondary branch. Its headquarters were in the capital, Deha. Both branches used to be the topmost academies across the entire Empire.<br/><br/>However, the previous leader of the Kirst branch had succumbed to injuries after being defeated in a spar, and the current chief was too young and inexperienced. The academy had thus faced a decline in recent years, eventually falling to the lowest rank of the Seven Pearls. Some were wondering if it even deserved to still be part of the Seven Pearls.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it was strange that Fang Xingjian had not once heard anything about magic prints ever since entering Kirst.<br/><br/>It was as if transitions using magic prints had never been a practice in this land. The transition methods they used in this world were ancient and monopolized by various large organisations and the imperial family.<br/><br/>They also had limited knowledge about Mages, and the majority of the commoners did not understand the extent of the Mages’ powers. This lack of understanding was inferior to many cultivators in Demonic City.<br/><br/>‘Did the Mages themselves prevent the information from spreading?’ Fang Xingjian wondered to himself. ‘Or did the earthlings do their own research and came up with the magic prints, just as the government said?’<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian could not figure it out, and had to continue relying on the sources around him.<br/><br/>“Hey, have you heard? The Black Mage King has taken in another disciple.”<br/><br/>“Huh? I wonder who’s so unlucky that they were taken in by those blasphemers for research.”<br/><br/>Hearing this, Fang Xingjian’s expression froze.<br/><br/>“Mage King… Onassis…” His fists were clenched so tightly they turned slightly white. There seemed to be a blazing fire in his heart.<br/><br/>Each sentence and word that he heard in any second during those seven days were clearly engraved in his heart.<br/><br/>Uranlis was one of the six countries on the mainland. It was ruled by Mages. The three strongest Mages were the only Mages who had reached the godlike level 30, and they were known as the Mage Kings.<br/><br/>Among them was the Black Mage King, who had the greatest interest in Earth, and who had supported the union and exchange between Uranlis and Earth.<br/><br/>Earth… Demonic City… Magic prints… Onassis Clan… Mage King… Everything seemed to be connected.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian instinctively knew there was a mystery to be solved here, but he also knew that now was not the time to explore it. Learning the art of the sword and becoming stronger were the most important matters at hand.<br/><br/>‘Then it has to be The School of Sword Arts…’<br/><br/>Tresia Knight Academy mostly groomed officials and royalty, and it was compulsory to study etiquette, theology, languages, military affairs, management, and various other skills. The academy also required many recommendations, strict qualifications, and a notable background. The School of Sword Arts, where anyone could enroll, would be better suited for Fang Xingjian.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian had also taken interest in a rumor saying that The School of Sword Arts had been amassing sword art techniques passed down through many generations.<br/><br/>Thus, Fang Xingjian arrived early the next day at the entrance of the school, which was located on a street in the eastern part of the city.<br/><br/>On a deserted street, there was a rusty metal door not even with a gatekeeper. By the looks of it, The School of Sword Arts was definitely ramshackled.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian tried pushing the door open and realized that the metal door was not even locked. He walked in with long strides, turned a corner, and found himself before a training ground with tens of apprentices sparring and practicing sword techniques, longswords in hand.<br/><br/>A young man wearing a grey training garb was instructing the apprentices on their swordsmanship as he paced around the training ground. He was blonde and had emerald eyes. He looked gaunt and malnourished, the only thing that made him stand out being the imperceptibly valiant spirit he exuded.<br/><br/>Spotting Fang Xingjian’s arrival, the young man gave a friendly expectant smile. Even though Fang Xingjian looked like a penniless wanderer, there wasn’t any hint of intolerance in his eyes.<br/><br/>“How are you? I am Kyle, the chief here. Are you here to learn swordsmanship? We have a hundred and fifty years’ worth of history, and our school is a Mecca for learning sword arts on the mainland.<br/><br/>“I see you have long and strong limbs. You are definitely a budding sword art apprentice. Would you like to train here with us? We will include a first job transition if you enroll here. Once you submit the tuition fee, all sword techniques are free to learn and teach…”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian looked stunned for a moment. The situation in this school seemed to be worse than what the rumors said.<br/><br/>“I’m here to learn sword arts,” he interrupted.<br/><br/>“Oh?” Kyle chuckled. “Good good good, but you have to pay the fees first. They’re paid every half a year for a total of thirty copper coins.”<br/><br/>Thirty copper coins. Fang Xingjian had earned around 100 copper coins on the way. The fees were fairly cheap. He nodded and passed over the money.<br/><br/>Kyle accepted happily with a relieved smile on his face.<br/><br/>“Good good good, come! I will first teach you the Basic Sword Technique of The School of Sword Arts, The Grizzly Bear Sword Technique.” With that, Kyle picked up a wooden sword from the side and began the drill.

Chapter 11 Grizzly Bear<br/><br/>After Kyle finished speaking, the wooden sword in his hands rose, and with it a vigorous aura appeared around him. The sword thrust out and swept to the side, creating a distinct sound of wind and thunder.<br/><br/>He concurrently explained, “The School of Sword Arts has a history of a hundred and fifty years, and it was founded by those who belonged to the previous generation of Outsiders from the Western Land, when they first came to the Empire.<br/><br/>However, during these past a hundred and fifty years, genius swordsmen have sprung out endlessly across generations, and the sword arts of our school have long since evolved from the style of the Western Land sword arts, eventually gaining a shape of their own. This Grizzly Bear Sword Technique has been improved and modified by many masters of swordsmanship in order to turn into what it is today.”<br/><br/>The muscles all over his body kept twisting and turning. Although the sword was in his hands, it was as if all his muscles’ power had been wrung into a single line. However, it was different from a human’s usual body constitution. The technique had its own unique rhythm, as if portraying a standing grizzly bear swaying right and left, and training the powers of the four limbs.<br/><br/>“Martial arts are divided into four types, namely Nurturing, Training, Amassing and Killing. Nurturing refers to the accumulation of the physical body’s potential. It is just like how a good sword requires daily maintenance, application of sword grease and blade polishing, to make it sharper and sharper. The same goes for the human body.<br/><br/>“Careful nurture is required in order to develop a strong base that may allow for the further development of one’s physical body.<br/><br/>“The Grizzly Bear Sword Technique is a Nurturing technique created by the masters of previous generations, designed to imitate the habits of grizzly bears, after a close observation of their movements.<br/><br/>“In the long run, practicing it will allow one to wring his or her body into a single line, thus gaining the strength of a grizzly bear.”<br/><br/>In between his words, the wooden sword trembled in Kyle’s hands, creating many afterimages. He suddenly swelled up like a grizzly bear woken up from deep hibernation, and the most powerful energy hidden in the human body exploded outwards.<br/><br/>A light roar echoed, as if a bear had cried out. With a thrust of Kyle’s sword, the air currents scattered the fallen leaves on the ground several feet away.<br/><br/>“When a bear hibernates, its whole body will tremble every few days. Thus, its muscles won’t stiffen, and its blood flow won’t stop, which would prove extremely harmful to its body. When we practice the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique, the most important thing to note is the trembling, as if all living things on earth have sprung to life at the sound of the spring thunder.<br/><br/>“This trembling is the Nurturing technique, and in it lie the profound mysteries of nurturing the human body.”<br/><br/>After demonstrating the full set of the Grizzly Bear Sword Techniques, Kyle retracted his sword as he turned and smiled at Fang Xingjian. “But, while this set of sword techniques seems easy, one has to slowly grasp and tune the weight, advance and retreat, and consider each move in its turn very carefully. It isn’t possible to master this in just a short moment.<br/><br/>“Today, I’ll teach you a few of the simplest moves…”<br/><br/>One could tell that Kyle, after accepting the tuition fees, was truly professional and did not hold back anything as he shared the essence of the Grizzly Bear Swordplay in its entirety with Fang Xingjian.<br/><br/>Of course, this was very similar to the countless other Nurturing techniques across the world. While the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique was powerful, it was in no way considered a peerless technique. But even through it alone one could already tell that this particular martial arts system was very well developed and thought-out, having become a unique part of this world’s culture.<br/><br/>Listening to Kyle’s explanation, Fang Xingjian’s gaze lit up. It was the first time he had listened to such an explanation for martial arts, and he suddenly felt as if everything had suddenly become very clear for him.<br/><br/>In the next moment, a new technique had popped into existence in his Techniques Column.<br/><br/>Level 1 Grizzly Bear Sword Technique: increases the potential of the human body and has the effect of gradually increasing strength and agility attributes.<br/><br/>To think that he had picked up the skill directly! It was not just that. With Kyle’s explanation and demonstration, he had also started following his movements in order to practice each step of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique.<br/><br/>Within a few minutes’ time, Kyle had stopped his actions, staring wide-eyed at Fang Xingjian, as if he were a monster.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian waved the wooden sword in his hands, his body trembling in synchronicity with the tip of the sword. It felt as if within each tremor the muscles all over his body were breathing along with the sword’s movements, as if a grizzly bear was scratching itself against a tree, the muscles and bones in its body trembling altogether.<br/><br/>‘How is this possible? When I saw him practicing the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique earlier, he was all in a flurry, he couldn’t grasp the weight of the movements, and he was breathing heavily as if he had never trained before.<br/><br/>‘How could it be that he’s mastered the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique merely within a few minutes’ time, as if he’d been training hard for months?’<br/><br/>On the other hand, Fang Xingjian was still immersed in the joy of leveling up his sword technique. He had been gifted with the world’s best talent in sword arts, and had then trained to get his Basic Sword Technique up to level 30, thus gaining the specialty Genius Swordsmanship. Therefore, it was no wonder he could pick up sword techniques at an exceptional speed.<br/><br/>With the additional acceleration, he was able to master level 3 of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique in just a few minutes’ time, something which would have taken an ordinary person half a year’s effort.<br/><br/>While there was no increase in his attributes at level 3 of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique, he felt as if the muscles and bones all over his body had been submerged into a hot spring, and as if multiple hands were giving him a full-body massage.<br/><br/>It was then when he suddenly noticed Kyle’s weird gaze and started to slow down the progress of his sword technique.<br/><br/>“Teacher, this set of sword techniques seems very familiar to me. It seems that there are many similarities between it and the Basic Sword Technique I’d learnt before.”<br/><br/>“Oh?”<br/><br/>With that, Fang Xingjian demonstrated his Basic Sword Technique to Kyle. The latter nodded with a gaze of appreciation. “Even though this set of Sword Techniques is simple and coarse, it includes the stances of most of the sword techniques in this world.<br/><br/>“What is even harder to come by is the sturdiness of your basics. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this. Adding to that your talent in swordsmanship, it’s no wonder you’re able to grasp the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique so quickly!<br/><br/>“However, whilst in the beginning the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique is easy, you still need to accurately grasp the correct way to channel the energy within your body for later on.”<br/><br/>Kyle thought that he could understand the reason why Fang Xingjian was able to grasp the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique so quickly. He nodded in admiration and worked even harder in teaching Fang Xingjian. His admiration for Fang Xingjian rose even higher after realizing that although he was highly talented, he was still able to devote so much effort towards setting such a strong base for his swordsmanship.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian, on the other hand, no longer dared to train at his full abilities, but held back instead. He knew that the talent which he had just shown had already far exceeded that of a normal person. If others were to find out that it would take him only a few days to level up the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique to level 20 or 30, he would no longer be seen as a talent but as a demon.<br/><br/>It would be good if the others were to admire him, but it would be unnecessary trouble if someone felt that something about his talent was amiss and wanted to look into it or to even put pressure on him.<br/><br/>Once his demonic talent was exposed, there would only be two possible options for him: to be pressured to death, or to forcibly comply to being someone else’s chess piece.<br/><br/>Currently, Fang Xingjian only wished to remain hidden in The School of Sword Arts, and to master all the sword techniques there in order to increase his powers.<br/><br/>Therefore, over the next few days, whenever Fang Xingjian met Kyle he would only reveal the equivalent of the level 1 Grizzly Bear Sword Technique, meanwhile secretly practicing by himself, repetitively breaking through levels, and even reaching level 12.<br/><br/>After breaking through level 10 of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique, he finally gained additional attributes consisting of a 2 points increase in strength, a 2 points increase in agility, an increase in the body’s potential, and an increase in the recovery speed from the exhaustion of his muscles and bones.

Chapter 12 Explanation<br/><br/>After training for a while, Fang Xingjian now had a deeper understanding of the reason why The School of Sword Arts was so dilapidated.<br/><br/>Kyle could be said to be the only person supporting The School of Sword Arts. He was a one-man show, from cleaning to lecturing. As for those who attended The School of Sword Arts, they were mainly little children and youngsters from the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Today, Kyle was lecturing on the of different categories of martial arts techniques.<br/><br/>“Martial techniques can be split into four categories, namely Nurturing, Training, Amassing, and Killing.” He was standing in front of all the students, explaining with confidence as the crowd listened with rapt attention.<br/><br/>In this ‘strength-dictates-all’ world, an individual’s level of power determined his or her future. The only way for ordinary people, or rather, commoners, to gain recognition was to raise their combat prowess. Being able to learn martial arts was their greatest blessing and also the best path they could take.<br/><br/>Therefore, it was many commoners’ choice. Most families would sacrifice a substantial portion of their resources just to invest into the nurture of their children’s martial arts cultivation.<br/><br/>Kyle continued, “Fifty years ago, the Divine Level Expert Rose Knight’s &lt;&gt; used the four seasons as a comparison to the four categories, Nurturing, Training, Amassing, Killing. It was eventually passed down to the future generations, who began using it more widely. I personally like this comparison a lot.<br/><br/>“The Nurturing Path is like Spring, nourishing all living things, cultivating the body, increasing one’s potential, and thus allowing the physical body to grow stronger naturally. It is like a seed planted in spring, gradually developing and growing strong.<br/><br/>“The Training Path is like the blazing summer; intense heat shining on one’s head, akin to the extreme tempering of the body, squeezing out every drop of potential and igniting the energy obtained from the Nurturing Path. But this is also the reason why I’ve never taught you this. Your training in the Nurturing Path is still insufficient, and your bodies’ potentials are still lacking for now. If you were to start on the Training Path now, it would be equivalent to exploiting your lifespan and depleting your potential.<br/><br/>” The normal procedure is to wait for your basic sword techniques to reach perfection, which means getting you to level 10 or above before we start on the Training Path.<br/><br/>“As for the Amassing Path, it is akin to late autumn. It is both the start to the harvesting of the fruit and the end to the miserable death of a myriad living things. It speaks of a spark of life in a world of silence. This describes the bettering of the physique through one’s breathing and blood circulation, and it is essentially a qualitative evolution in one’s way of living.<br/><br/>“However, the Amassing Path is too profound and has extremely high requirements. It isn’t time for you guys to learn this just yet.”<br/><br/>Looking at the disheartened expressions appearing on his students’ faces, Kyle smiled as he continued, “Now for the last one, the Killing Path. It’s simple to speak of, since it’s purely combat and killing techniques, which can be compared to the bitter cold of winter, smothering all life.<br/><br/>“This type of technique is an entirely different concept compared to the usual ones, which mainly train your body.”<br/><br/>“Teacher, when can you teach us the Killing Path?” inquired a chestnut-haired youngster who seemed to be less than twenty years of age. He was about 1.9 meters tall and extremely muscular, giving the impression of a small mountain to people who looked at him.<br/><br/>His name was Ogden, and he was considered one of the most senior students at The School of Sword Arts, and even the Eldest Martial Brother. Regardless of stats or techniques, he was undoubtedly the strongest in the group of students.<br/><br/>Hearing Ogden’s question, Kyle laughed as he shook his head. “Now is the time for you to establish your foundation. Learning the Killing Path too soon wouldn’t be beneficial for the nurturing and the training of your body.<br/><br/>“Alright. That will be all for today. Next, we will start a round of practice for the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique.”<br/><br/>At that moment, from the back of the class, Fang Xingjian raised his hands as he inquired, “Teacher, I have a question.”<br/><br/>Seeing Fang Xingjian raise his hand to ask a question, encouragement flickered in Kyle’s eyes. Fang Xingjian’s talent, and the effort he had put in these past few days were very obvious to Kyle, so he had nothing but admiration for this student of his.<br/><br/>“Speak.”<br/><br/>“I wanted to ask… When training sword techniques, after reaching level 10 one would gain an increase in attributes for the majority of the sword techniques. What is the reason behind this? What happens if a cultivator practices over a hundred different sword techniques up to level 10? Wouldn’t one be invincible then?”<br/><br/>This was one of the questions that he had been constantly pondering recently, as it also concerned him whether his strength would continue to increase at the current rate of progress.<br/><br/>After hearing Fang Xingjian’s question, Kyle smiled. “Firstly, you are speaking of someone who has mastered over a hundred different sword techniques. That is pretty much impossible. A warrior with an average talent would have to practice a particular set of sword techniques over a hundred thousand or over one million times before he can be proficient in it. It would take roughly five to ten years before his sword technique could reach level 10, and at least several thousand years for him to reach this level for all one hundred sword techniques.<br/><br/>“Even if the person is one of those rumored geniuses with a learning speed ten times faster than others, one would need between half a year and a year to attain level 10 in each of the sword techniques. Not only that, one would still need several hundred years of relentless practice without even taking the time to eat or drink before being able to achieve this.<br/><br/>“Naturally, there are also legendary geniuses who would be able to achieve this. However, geniuses at this level are extremely rare. One can’t see such a talent in several decades. You might not even get to meet one in your entire life.”<br/><br/>After saying this, Kyle paused for a while before addressing Fang Xingjian’s other question, “As for the question regarding the increase in one’s attributes after reaching level 10 in a particular technique, the theory behind it is extremely profound. Even the experts from the headquarters might not be able to fully grasp it.<br/><br/>“However, a majority of experts jointly agreed upon some conjectures.<br/><br/>“Basically, after a new technique reaches level 10, it enhances and improves the method of circulation within a human’s body, reducing the restrictive forces around one’s muscles, bone structure and vessels. Thus it allows one’s strength, agility, and other attributes to be displayed more efficiently.<br/><br/>“There are rumours that the lords from the Royal Knight Academy have performed an experiment before. When martial techniques that are similar in nature reach level 10, only the first one of their kind would bring an increase in attributes. This aligns to the conjecture. Of course, the methods in the Nurturing Path and the Amassing Path which can strengthen the body, establish one’s foundation and ignite one’s potential are not taken into account concerning this theory. Those are ways of transforming one’s physique, and of gaining increases in attribute stats on a fundamental level.<br/><br/>“However, similar techniques of the Amassing or the Nurturing Path are likely to overlap as well when they reach level 10.”<br/><br/>Hearing Kyle’s words, comprehension flashed in Fang Xingjian’s eyes. The stats-boost gained from sword techniques was actually caused by the leveling up.<br/><br/>Simply put, if a person’s muscles had the brute strength of one ton, the contradictions between the muscles and bone structure would only enable him to have 100 jin worth of strength output. Only after learning martial arts and learning how to exert strength properly would the internal dissipation of power when it passed by the bones and muscles be reduced, thus enabling a strength output of 200 jin.<br/><br/>Fan Xingjian’s sword arts practice was precisely the cause of the increase in attributes and the additional one hundred jin of strength.<br/><br/>‘So that was the case? If this is true, then only one technique out of a multitude of similar sword techniques would bring stats increase, while the others would have no effect on me? Well, in any case I will only know after trying them out. Anyway, with the talent and learning speed I have now I can easily master the majority of sword techniques the very instant I learn them, so there’s no harm in learning more.’<br/><br/>After this, Kyle once again directed and guided the students in their practice of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique. This basic sword technique of The School of Sword Arts was profound and all-encompassing, easy to learn but tough to master. However, it could strengthen one’s physique and increase one’s potential. As a result, the students of The School of Sword Arts would generally have to practice it several times every single day.<br/><br/>However, this time round, after a few training sets, Kyle pointed to Eldest Martial Brother Ogden as he shook his head, “What’s wrong with you? How many times have I told you that what the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique needs is both physical and mental control? The crux is in the tremble. You are merely using brute strength, and this is why you’re still unable to break through to level 10. Now, each time you’re practicing the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique, you’re no longer gaining any experience points, am I right?”<br/><br/>Ogden lowered his head as he replied, somewhat shamefaced, “I’ve honestly been practicing eight hours every single day, but I have no idea why, ever since I’ve reached level 9, I’m no longer gaining any experience points.”<br/><br/>Ogden’s pain was something Kyle understood. Commoners’ descendants like Ogden could only rely on martial arts for a way out of their situation. Ogden had been training in The School of Sword Arts ever since he had been eight, and his physique had been trained to far surpass that of ordinary humans. He had a surplus of 15 points in the strength, agility, and endurance attributes, all of which he had gained through training.<br/><br/>Other than leveling up techniques or leveling up oneself, another way to increase attributes was to train the body daily. For example, after practicing the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique of The School of Sword Arts, one would gain a miraculous increase in strength and agility.<br/><br/>However, there was a limit to this type of training as well. The higher one’s original attributes were, the lower the training’s effect would be.<br/><br/>For example, Ogden’s level 9 Grizzly Bear Sword Technique had already ceased adding a strengthening effect to his body. If he still wanted to gain an increase in attributes through this method, he would have to make a breakthrough with the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique.<br/><br/>Kyle shook his head, pointing at Fang Xingjian at the side, and said, “Come, demonstrate the movements of the technique we were just practicing. The rest of you, take a good look.”

Chapter 13 Progress<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian did not find this unexpected as he stepped out with the wooden practice sword in his hands. He started to demonstrate the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique, but he tried his best to be clumsy in his demonstration, displaying a level 2 or 3 standard of the technique.<br/><br/>Even so, he was still able to perform the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique close to perfection, astonishing Kyle yet again.<br/><br/>“That’s right, that’s right. You guys take a good look. The Grizzly Bear Sword Technique requires one to sway the neck, chest, and abdomen as well as the shoulders, just like a bear! The neck must be relaxed, and the waist must tremble.<br/><br/>“Xingjian’s level is not as high as the rest of yours, but his control is something you need to learn. He is already on the right path, just waiting to arrive at the destination, while some of you are taking a big detour, circling around it.”<br/><br/>After Fang Xingjian’s demonstration, Kyle nodded in satisfaction. “Not bad. Xingjian, you can go practice by yourself.”<br/><br/>After saying that, he turned to look sternly at Ogden, saying, “Did you see that? You need to learn from him. Although the level of your technique is higher than Fang Xingjian’s, you haven’t really grasped its essence. From now on, learning the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique will definitely be a smooth-sailing journey for him. Unlike you, who keeps stumbling upon so many bottlenecks.<br/><br/>“Continue practicing. How will you pass the upcoming Prefectural Selection if you do not breakthrough into level 10 of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian walked to the side and focused on his own training as the ‘Prefectural Selection’ that Kyle had mentioned earlier flashed through his mind.<br/><br/>The Empire’s upper echelon was mostly controlled by famous influential groups of aristocrats, and by royalty. One could only choose to join one of these groups in order to become stronger and have access to more training resources.<br/><br/>Unlike those of the second generation, born with silver spoons in their mouths and with inherited authority to various degrees, with recommendations and aid in their progress on different paths, commoners only had one way to climb up the ladder, namely to pass the Grand Selection.<br/><br/>The Grand Selection had different stages: the Prefectural Selection, the Regional Selection, and the National Selection. The Prefectural Selection took place every year, the Regional Selection every two years, and the National Selection once every three years.<br/><br/>Hundreds or even thousands of carefully selected elites would participate in each stage, and the country granted special privileges and rewards to those who passed the selection.<br/><br/>Some of them included the right to enter the Royal Academy, titles of nobility, land, mansions, tax exemptions, or even the offer of a job transition.<br/><br/>Regardless of the amount of training, if one did not participate in the Grand Selection, one would stay a mere commoner.<br/><br/>The Grand Selection was the optimal path for all commoners, as it selected a massive number of talents for the Empire every year.<br/><br/>‘One can go through a normal job transition in various schools, but the resources of an ordinary school cannot compare to those which are backed up by large countries.’ Fang Xingjian had long since made up his mind. ‘I must take part in the Grand Selection, starting with the upcoming Prefectural Selection five months away. I must attain the status of a Knight and get accepted into Kirst’s Royal Academy!’<br/><br/>That’s right. The best amongst Kirst’s Seven Pearl Academies. Only when he passed the Prefectural Selection and advanced as a Knight would he be able to enter Kirst’s Royal Academy.<br/><br/>Thinking about this, Fang Xingjian’s gaze turned cold as his grip on the wooden sword suddenly became more vigorous. As he practiced his sword techniques, his thoughts continued to swirl around in his mind.<br/><br/>‘Concerning living expenses, maybe I can think of a way to get them through The School of Sword Arts…<br/><br/>‘What is most important is to practice my sword arts and to prepare for the Prefectural Selection.<br/><br/>‘The Empire’s selections are spread out like this: the Prefectural Selection once a year, the Regional Selection once every two years, and the National Selection once every three years.<br/><br/>‘It’s great timing that the Prefectural Selection is this year, the Regional Selection next year, and the National Selection the year after the next. I only have five years left of my lifespan, and this will be my only chance. If I want to take revenge and become stronger, I must climb up the ladder, so I can tap into the Empire’s resources and pair them with my talent…’<br/><br/>Once participants advanced to the Prefectural Selection and became Knights, the Empire would nurture them through their first job transitions.<br/><br/>Once they advanced to the Regional Selection and became Conferred Knights, the Empire would nurture them through their second job transitions.<br/><br/>Once they advanced to the final National Selection and became Royal Knights, the Empire would use all its means to nurture them through their third job transitions.<br/><br/>From level 1 all the way to level 30, this was the advancement process for Warriors who joined the Empire.<br/><br/>In a moment, the stats in his Techniques Column jumped as his Grizzly Bear Sword Technique leveled up to 18.<br/><br/>‘An ordinary person can only train to level 10, but I can exceed this restriction by such a margin!<br/><br/>There’s no problem… As long as I continue to progress like this, I’ll be able to gain sufficient power…’<br/><br/>Sparks of vengeance flashed in Fang Xingjian’s eyes yet again. Li Shuanghua’s viciousness and Caroline’s torture were both like venomous snakes tearing through his soul.<br/><br/>He raised his head to look at the surroundings. On the training grounds, regardless if they were eight or nine year old children, teenagers, or youngsters in their twenties, each and every one of the students was focusing hard on their training, perspiring profusely. None of them was slacking off.<br/><br/>The Miracle World’s martial arts culture was many times more developed than that of Demonic City’s. More than half the students on the training grounds were currently much stronger than Fang Xingjian had been back in Demonic City.<br/><br/>After giving guidance to a group of students, Kyle called out to everyone from the middle of the training grounds. “Alright, I’ll be heading out. I’ve had some things to attend to recently, and may not be here often these days. If you guys face any problems, just discuss them amongst yourselves.”<br/><br/>The next moment, Fang Xingjian turned around and saw Eldest Martial Brother Ogden walking towards him. It seemed as if his well-trained body was bursting out of his training clothes, making the ground tremble slightly with each step.<br/><br/>Although he knew that Teacher Kyle was definitely stronger than Eldest Martial Brother Ogden, putting aside true strength and looking merely at auras, Brother Ogden seemed to exert a stronger pressure than Kyle.<br/><br/>Ogden had been training in The School of Sword Arts since young, continually building up his physical body. Moreover, the school had other techniques besides the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique which he had learned. However, Ogden now needed to deal with a bottleneck in his Grizzly Bear Sword Technique.<br/><br/>Facing Fang Xingjian, the Eldest Martial Brother grinned and said, “Martial Brother Xingjian, the teacher said that your comprehension of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique is better than mine. Do you mind if I practice next to you?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian threw him a glance. Having just joined, he did not think it would be wise of him to make enemies. Furthermore, the other party had no ill intentions. Even if Fang Xingjian did not agree, what could stop Ogden from practicing beside him either way?<br/><br/>Therefore, he nodded and said, “It’s fine.”<br/><br/>Ogden nodded as well, gratified. “Thank you very much. I’ve attempted the Prefectural Selection three times so far, but failed each time. If I fail again, my dad has already arranged a job as a city guard for me. So I must definitely pass the Prefectural Selection this time.”<br/><br/>With that, Fang Xingjian continued practicing. Ogden beside him was imitating his practice movements as he trained the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian did not pay him any heed, but focused on his own practice. Seeing how even Ogden was following Fang Xingjian in his practice, eventually five or six other young boys who had just started their training also joined in.<br/><br/>“This Fang Xingjian is really good. I feel that his display of the sword technique is quite similar to Teacher Kyle’s.”<br/><br/>“Mmm, it really is similar to Teacher Kyle’s.”<br/><br/>“This is good. If we continue to practice with him, we will be able to correct our movements.”<br/><br/>About half of the students were practicing the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique with Fang Xingjian. Meanwhile, in another corner, a few guys were watching him, unfazed.<br/><br/>A slightly gloomy red-haired guy mumbled, “This guy is really arrogant. Is he going to have us seniors, who have practiced for several years now, learn from him?”<br/><br/>Beside him stood a slender guy with well-proportioned muscles, akin to a perfect sculpture.<br/><br/>His name was Lambert, and he ranked second in seniority amongst the students in The School of Sword Arts. He was often referred to as Second Martial Brother. Similar to Ogden, he had reached the pinnacle of level 9, but had yet to go through the job transition. He had picked up various sword arts concurrently, and in terms of abilities he was second only to Ogden.<br/><br/>His companion by the side said, “That’s right. He’s trying to teach us, when he’s only been here a few days.”<br/><br/>“Shall we teach him a lesson?”<br/><br/>“What’s there to teach?” Lambert gave a cold laugh and turned away. “Remember, our real goal is the Prefectural Selection. This time around, I will definitely leave this place and enter the Royal Academy. Meanwhile he’ll have to stay in The School of Sword Arts and train for at least a few more years. Forget about such trivialities.<br/><br/>“Alright, spend your time wisely on practicing sword arts. The Prefectural Selection is only five months away.”<br/><br/>…<br/><br/>A few hours later… No matter how strong Fang Xingjian’s body was, he started to feel a gradual ache originating from the muscles in his limbs and body. He immediately stopped to take a short break.<br/><br/>After all, he was only human and not a robot. His body was experiencing fatigue.

Chapter 14 Focus<br/><br/>“Obtaining the topmost degree of sword arts talent in the world requires giving up seventy-two years of lifespan, which leaves you with only five more years of your life. At the same time, you will never be able to feel love, kinship, and friendship, and you’ll end up leading a lonely life until your death, unable to procreate, or to have any descendants.<br/><br/>“From now onwards, everything related to happiness in the human world shall no longer be of your concern. Are you willing to accept this?”<br/><br/>‘Of course.<br/><br/>‘Bearing such an enormous grudge, of course I would like to have my revenge! How could I not want power?’<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian was on the training grounds. Recalling the price he had paid, his cold eyes lit up once again with killing intent. The speed of the sword in his hand rose, as if to eradicate everything before him.<br/><br/>“Xingjian, Xingjian! Are you alright?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian came back to his senses, realizing that everyone was staring at him, stunned. The tip of his sword was right at the chest of another student.<br/><br/>“I’m sorry, I’m going to take a break.” Shaking his head, Fang Xingjian sheathed his sword and headed to a corner at the side.<br/><br/>About ten more days passed by. Looking at his Techniques Column, Fang Xingjian could tell that the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique had reached level 27. The additional attributes were a 4 point increase in strength and a 4 point increase in agility. The potential of his physical body had increased a lot, bringing along improvements in his recovery speed after the exhaustion of his muscles and bones.<br/><br/>Other than the attributes created by the release of his body’s potential, the effects of his daily practice of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique had far exceeded that of an ordinary student. Day by day, he could feel his muscles and bones being nurtured and growing as if he were an evolving seed, as if he had returned to the time when he had been an infant. As a result, his appetite had greatly increased as well.<br/><br/>Although there had been no changes to the five major attributes on his Stats Window, he believed that if he kept going with his practice of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique, it would only be natural for his body to become stronger and for his attributes to increase.<br/><br/>Within almost a month’s time, Fang Xingjian had consecutively picked up the Eagle Sword Technique and the Tenauer-Style Body Strengthening Sword Technique.<br/><br/>Out of these two, the Eagle Sword Technique was one of the basic sword techniques in The School of Sword Arts. It complemented the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique well, and it was able to fully tap into the the human body’s potential, strengthening its attributes.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the Tenauer-Style Body Strengthening Sword Technique was a basic dual-wielding sword technique created by the Empire’s Sword Saint, St. John Tenauer. Training the body’s flexibility, reaction, movements and joints, it was widely used in the military, and was eventually adopted even by major academies and factions, thus becoming a must-learn basic dual-wielding sword technique.<br/><br/>Within ten days or so, Fang Xingjian had not only reached level 27 for the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique, his Eagle Sword technique and Tenauer-Style Body Strengthening Sword Technique had also reached level 12, and 9 respectively.<br/><br/>He had gotten his first attribute increase from the Eagle Sword Technique, which included 1 point in agility, 1 point in reaction, 1 point in endurance, and 1 point in flexibility, along with an increase in the body’s potential, in its physical strength, and in the mind’s and body’s agility.<br/><br/>As for the Tenauer-Style Body Strengthening Sword Technique, he was about to reach a breakthrough soon. He decided to buck up and practice until he would reach level 10.<br/><br/>He had devoted all his time to the tough training, to the extent that his endurance had also increased by 1 point.<br/><br/>If others were to find out that he had spent just slightly over 10 days to attain the level of training which would take others over 10 years, he would probably be considered the top genius across the world, right away.<br/><br/>But even if he would hold back on revealing his actual powers and would keep a low profile, Fang Xingjian had already attracted quite a lot of attention within The School of Sword Arts, as he had managed to pick up three sword techniques within merely over 10 days’ time. It would have probably taken one to two months for a person with mediocre talent to grasp these three sword techniques.<br/><br/>However, talent was something that others could only be jealous of. As a result, because the students were full of envy and admiration for Fang Xingjian, even more of them were putting in effort into their practice, for fear of being left behind.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Teacher Kyle did just as he had said, appearing only once in the morning and once in the afternoon, giving guidance before he quickly took his leave.<br/><br/>When the students had questions during their practice, they would look for Ogden, Lambert, or Fang Xingjian.<br/><br/>“Martial… Martial Brother Fang?”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian raised his head and saw a silvered-haired young girl standing before him. The young girl seemed very shy, staring at the ground. After gathering enough courage to raise her head, she immediately lowered it again like a startled deer once she exchanged a short glance with Fang Xingjian.<br/><br/>This young girl’s name was Vivian, and she was considered a rare beauty amongst The School of Sword Arts’ students. Since females were also allowed to train and to get stronger, their social status was not too far from that of the males. Many prestigious powerful Warriors had been women, including the Rose Knight who, as Kyle had mentioned before, was the first to compare the four types of martial arts with the four seasons.<br/><br/>Because of her good looks, Vivian was quite popular amongst the students in The School of Sword Arts, and there were quite a few young boys who had a crush on her.<br/><br/>Following Fang Xingjian’s sudden appearance, these past few days everyone had figured out the fact that he was a genius with the sword, and even more students had started practicing with him. Vivian was one of them.<br/><br/>“What’s the matter?” But, no matter how beautiful she was, it was impossible for her to leave any traces on Fang Xingjian’s heart since he had lost the feeling of love.<br/><br/>Hearing his cold tone, Vivian’s eyelashes trembled, as if she would break out in tears at any point. She spoke in an extremely soft voice, saying, “Martial… Martial Brother Fang, I haven’t had much pro… progress in the Eagle Sword Technique recently.” Her hands were entwined, her tone was shuddering and extremely feeble, making it seem as if Fang Xingjian was bullying her.<br/><br/>“I think that Martial Brother Fang is very talented and good with the sword. Can I trouble you to give me some pointers?”<br/><br/>“If you want to learn, you can observe from the side. I have no time to give guidance.”<br/><br/>“Huh?” Vivian raised her head and saw that Fang Xingjian had already found a spot a quite a distance away and had started his practice. She bit her lips, but continued to follow Fang Xingjian’s movements, practicing her sword technique.<br/><br/>During the next few days, Vivian continued to stay around Fang Xingjian, serving him tea, water, and even food, trying her utmost to please him. The other students were all full of envy.<br/><br/>From a distance, Second Martial Brother Lambert was squinting his eyes at the sight. He gave a cold, disdainful laughter.<br/><br/>‘Genius? Not every genius can pass the Prefectural Selection. It’ll be quite a few years before you’ll be able to pass. By then, I’ll have graduated from the Royal Academy and would be on my way to participating in the Regional Selection.<br/><br/>‘The real battlefield is during the Empire’s selections.’<br/><br/>After giving it some thought, he calmed his thoughts and focused on his training. Behind him, there was another group of students following him as he practiced.<br/><br/>Beside Fang Xingjian, Ogden had not glanced at Vivian at all, devoting all his attention to practicing the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique. It was as if the sword in his hand was the only thing left in the world.<br/><br/>The other students in the training grounds had also been distracted only for a short moment, and most of them had directed their focus to their training once again.<br/><br/>The Grand Selection. Passing the Prefectural Selection and becoming a knight. Everyone was clenching their teeth as they headed for their dreams.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian repetitively practiced the twenty-one movements and stances of the Tenauer-Style Body Strengthening Sword Technique and unknowingly got immersed in it. He only felt that the two swords in his hands, combined with different stances and grasps, had gradually evolved into various combinations. An overwhelming sense of mystery enshrouded him, continuously correcting his movements.<br/><br/>Tenauer-Style Body Strengthening Sword Technique level 13. An additional 1 point for agility, 2 points for reaction, 1 point for flexibility, plus an increase in the flexibility and strength of joints and ligaments, which raised the consistency of attack and sword practice.<br/><br/>By the time Fang Xingjian felt that all his four limbs aching, his Tenauer-Style Body Strengthening Sword Technique had increased another level. He came to his senses and noticed that night had already fallen, the moon and stars filling up the sky. But at least a third of the students were still there, still practicing hard. There were also five or six students who had just come out of the canteen and were doing warm-ups, getting ready to continue with their practice after a short break.<br/><br/>It was as if a sense of urgency had swept through the air.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian took in a deep breath as he further drowned himself in sword practice.<br/><br/>His five major attributes had changed to strength 18, agility 22, reaction 11, endurance 7 and flexibility 12.

Chapter 15 Knight<br/><br/>In the morning, before the sky had fully brightened, many students from The School of Sword Arts had already rushed to the training grounds, yawning.<br/><br/>It was four and a half months before the Prefectural Selection, and most of the students from The School of Sword Arts had planned to register. There were a few of them, like Ogden, who had participated in the selections many times but had ultimately failed. This group of students worked even harder than usual in practice, only heading to sleep late at night.<br/><br/>This was also because the Nurturing martial arts were not harmful to the body, and after adjusting to the intensity of workout, one could practice them daily for long stretches of time.<br/><br/>Not long after, Kyle also came out from his room, coughing a few times. Everyone started their practice under his guidance.<br/><br/>Just as he had mentioned earlier, Teacher Kyle seemed to have become busier recently, and the time he spent giving guidance became shorter and shorter each day. However, his energy seemed to increase by the day, like a rusty sword regaining its glamor.<br/><br/>About an hour later, the morning practice ended, and everyone headed for the canteen. All the food in The School of Sword Arts’ canteen was prepared by a kitchen helper hired by Kyle.<br/><br/>Breakfast was two pieces of black-colored bread, each the size of a fist. Lunch was a piece of pork the size of an infant’s palm, a bowl of vegetables, and a piece of bread. The two meals cost 4 coppers overall.<br/><br/>Most commoners only ate breakfast and lunch, skipping dinner.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian also headed for the canteen. At the side, there were a few students who took out dry rations they had prepared themselves. These students could not afford to have breakfast in The School of Sword Arts. Fang Xingjian could not bear the cost either, but it was even more difficult for him to cook for himself or to go out for food. The former wasted time and the latter was too expensive.<br/><br/>After collecting two pieces of black bread from the kitchen helper, Fang Xingjian started chewing on them. The black bread was mixed with wheat skin and sprout, crushed together in the process when wheat was ground into flour. The texture was very poor and coarse, and the taste even had a hint of sourness.<br/><br/>Although the food was coarse, it was filling, nutritious, and easily digestible. It was the type of food that commoners ate the most.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian finished his bread in two or three bites, but his stomach had yet to be filled. People who trained as much as they did required a larger amount of food.<br/><br/>If they would have been able to enjoy meat, vegetables, and fruits on a daily basis, the results of their training would have greatly improved.<br/><br/>But in reality, they had no money…<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian looked around him and saw that most of the students had gobbled down their share of bread, but still seemed unsatisfied.<br/><br/>Students would generally start training from the age of seven or eight. Most of their time would be spent on training. Thus, not only were they unable to contribute to the family’s income, they also became huge burdens.<br/><br/>This was why all the students treasured their food.<br/><br/>As for those descending from families of aristocrats or Knights, not only could they go ahead with their practice without any worries, they could also get the guidance of renowned teachers. In addition, they could obtain a large amount of nutrients from their good food, which allowed their physiques to far surpass those of ordinary students.<br/><br/>“If only I could get a bit more…” Fang Xingjian thought to himself.<br/><br/>At that moment, Vivian walked to Fang Xingjian, holding out half a piece of black bread. She said, “Martial Brother Fang, this is too much for me to finish. You can have it.”<br/><br/>Gulping down his saliva, Fang Xingjian eventually shook his head and said, “No need.”<br/><br/>“It’s fine.” Vivian smiled, and it was as if a beam of warm sunlight had shone on Fang Xingjian’s chest. She pushed the bread into Fang Xingjian’s hand and said, “You can have it.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian knew that since he needed to become stronger and needed to take revenge within five years, he could not let go of even the tiniest opportunity to grow stronger. He looked at the piece of bread in his hand and hesitated for a short moment before his hunger got the better of his pride, and he quickly gobbled it down.<br/><br/>At the same time, Fang Xingjian mumbled, “This afternoon, I will guide you in your Eagle Sword Technique.”<br/><br/>Vivian’s eyes lit up. “Thank… Thank you, Martial Brother!”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian did not say much, only thinking to himself, ‘While I spend every night under the bridge, food alone is costing me almost all of my money. It’s time to think of a way to earn money.’<br/><br/>However, while he was still thinking about how he could earn money, he heard noises coming from the training grounds.<br/><br/>A golden-haired youngster was standing before Teacher Kyle. The youth had straight brows and bright eyes, and his golden hair shone with a dazzling glow underneath the sunlight. Both his handsome face and his exquisite clothing made him seem like Prince Charming to all the female students. The silver-plated sword at his waist was also a cause of envy among the commoner students.<br/><br/>However, compared to the dazzling golden-haired youth, what was even more striking was the sturdy man standing beside him, talking with Kyle. Just like Fang Xingjian, the man had black hair, black eyes, and yellow skin. It was obvious that he was one of the westerners in this world, and not a native of the Empire.<br/><br/>Even so, westerners were not really considered rare in the Empire. Compared to his appearance, the blue suit he was dressed in drew more attention.<br/><br/>“Is that Knight attire?” a student whispered.<br/><br/>Knight attire was made of materials from three extremely strong ferocious beasts, namely the Dragon Bird, the Fire Unicorn, and the Sturgeon Unicorn. Each piece of Knight attire was meticulously produced by the country’s armory. Only those who were able to pass the Empire’s Prefectural Selection and become Knights would be able to obtain the Knight attire.<br/><br/>Also, each set was equipped with the ability to fend off fiery arrows, being light as a feather and impenetrable at the same time. They were even said to be a treasured defensive item of the highest quality, many of them becoming the heirlooms of many families, despite the fact that anyone who was not a Knight would be sentenced to death if they wore one.<br/><br/>It was all because of the identity represented by the ones wearing these suits – the Knights. Every year, there would only be ten privileged individuals from the Prefectural Selection across different prefectures, carefully chosen from thousands of participants.<br/><br/>Looking at the Knight before them, or rather at the Knight attire, flames of envy lit up in the eyes of many of the students.<br/><br/>Second Martial Brother Lambert clenched his fist and thought to himself, “This time around, I must definitely pass the Prefectural Selection and become a Knight.”<br/><br/>“Kni—ght.” Eldest Martial Brother Ogden clenched his teeth, feeling more determined than ever. “I must definitely become a Knight. As long as I become a Knight, I will be exempt from military taxes and be granted land. With these, big brother would not have to stay single, and our parents would not have to sell off our youngest sister…”<br/><br/>Becoming a Knight made one exempt from paying military taxes, and also granted one land from the country’s funds. One would be able to fully focus on their training from then on, no longer distracted by daily miscellaneous affairs. The best thing was that only the Royal Knight Association would be able to conduct a trial for Knights who had broken the law. Ordinary officials did not have the right to put them on trial.<br/><br/>Looking at the Knight before him, what Fang Xingjian thought of was not the superiority of his identity, but ‘Has this fellow already completed his first job transition?’<br/><br/>Warriors in Demonic City used magic prints to complete job transitions, unlike the people in this world. Fang Xingjian had asked around long ago about how they performed job transitions.<br/><br/>Similarly, they would reach bottlenecks at levels 9, 19 and 29, and they would no longer be able to gain any experience through reading, learning, training, and killing monsters.<br/><br/>At that time, only when they entered a secret realm could they break through the bottleneck and undergo the job transition.

</div><div class="Readarea ReadAjax_content" id="chaptercontent">
Chapter 16 Kaunitz<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian did not understand what the so-called secret realms looked like, nor did he know how to complete a job transition or which job to choose. The students did not know either, and Kyle had never explained the process.<br/><br/>In this world, the government and the major sects controlled all the job transition channels. One had to be acknowledged by the government or by a major sect before being allowed to enter a secret realm.<br/><br/>As for the job transition specifics, these were kept under wraps by the most influential groups, the commoners thus being left clueless.<br/><br/>In case one desired to enter a secret realm for an official job transition, one had to join a clan and become its disciple, putting the clan’s interests above the country’s.<br/><br/>Alternatively, one could compete as an average student in the Empire’s selections, in order to obtain the same status as those of the middle-ranking class, such as the Knights.<br/><br/>Of course, regardless of the chosen option, one had to pass layers and layers of professional examinations.<br/><br/>Initially, Fang Xingjian had considered entering The School of Sword Arts in order to become a disciple. Afterall, swordsmanship was its forte, and The School of Sword Arts’ headquarters in the Empire’s capital city was renowned across the whole mainland.<br/><br/>The truth was that, either intentionally or not, Kyle had been sounding him out regarding his interest in becoming an official disciple and leaving for the headquarters in order to train there.<br/><br/>However, Fang Xingjian gave up the thought in the end, because of an undisputed principle.<br/><br/>In this world, the Empire’s royal family was the biggest faction.<br/><br/>This faction of royalty could select any of the country’s best talents, defeat hundreds and thousands other factions, and control the country’s natural resources. It was definitely the greatest and strongest faction.<br/><br/>In five years, Fang Xingjian wanted to become strong, seek revenge, and improve himself as fast as possible. Evidently, he had to join the strongest power in order to become the strongest and to accomplish all these.<br/><br/>He trusted his abilities. He believed that he would be able to pass the Prefectural Selection and become a Knight, to pass the Regional Selection and become a Model Knight, and even to pass the National Selection and become a Royal Knight.<br/><br/>In other words, if Fang Xingjian, with his abilities, could not do it… then who could?<br/><br/>On the other side, the black-haired Knight who was talking to Kyle noticed the people’s envious and adoring looks and laughed casually. He had seen far too many such gazes and thought nothing of them. He then nodded to Kyle and said, “Then, Teacher Kyle, so it shall be.”<br/><br/>With that, he gave a short nod to the golden-haired youngster, and turned to leave.<br/><br/>Kyle clapped his hands to gain everyone’s attention. “Alright, stop staring. There are a few things that I want you all to know.” He waved at the golden-haired youngster, and with a benevolent look, he said, “This is your new classmate, Kaunitz Tresia. From now on until the Prefectural Selection, he will be learning the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique and the Eagle Sword Technique here, with the rest of you.<br/><br/>Kaunitz will be taking part in the selections as well, so everyone, help each other out and learn from each other!”<br/><br/>“Kaunitz Tresia?”<br/><br/>“Doesn’t this name sound familiar?”<br/><br/>“Hey, could he be the Kaunitz Tresia?”<br/><br/>“Darn, don’t tell me that the Knight was their retainer!”<br/><br/>“He’s truly a man who has inherited centuries of nobility.”<br/><br/>Second Martial Brother Lambert’s eyes narrowed and locked on the person before him, Kaunitz Tresia. He thought to himself, unconvinced, ‘Is this really Tresia Knight Academy’s super genius, Kaunitz Tresia?<br/><br/>‘The entire Tresia Knight Academy belongs to his family. Why would he come to The School of Sword Arts to train?<br/><br/>‘Wait. It was rumored that he had already learnt more than five Tresia Knight Academy sword art techniques even before he turned twelve. He’s now a seventeen-year-old. Could he have already perfected all levels of the academy’s seven sword art techniques? Is that why he’s here? To learn new sword art techniques from the renowned The School of Sword Arts?<br/><br/>‘How could this be?’<br/><br/>Alarmed by his own conclusions, Lambert clenched his hands tightly. ‘It is said that Kaunitz was focusing on practicing his swordsmanship in the past, and did not participate in the Prefectural Selection. Is he going to enter in this coming selection?<br/><br/>‘I could never rival such a genius. Not someone who’s been groomed by his entire noble family since young.<br/><br/>‘Darn! The Prefectural Selection has yet to start, and one of the ten places has already been taken…’<br/><br/>The students’ faces expressed a mixture of anxiety, shock, and envy, but the golden-haired Kaunitz stared back at the crowd with a cold, aloof gaze. He chose to ignore all of the friendly smiles and greetings from his fellow students.<br/><br/>After all, when compared to Tresia Knight Academy, The School of Sword Arts was just trash. He was destined not to stay here for long.<br/><br/>Even passing the Prefectural Selection was simply to be expected of him. His goal was to come out on top in both the Prefectural Selection and the Regional Selection in the following year, consecutively passing both selections to become a Model Knight.<br/><br/>“Alright. Everyone, back to practice! There are only another four and a half months until the Prefectural Selection. All of you had better make the most of it!<br/><br/>“Kaunitz, come here. I’ll teach you the Eagle Sword Technique and the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique,” Kyle said as the rest of the students resumed their training.<br/><br/>In the following days, since Kyle had to teach Kaunitz, the leftover time dedicated to explaining to the other students dwindled. Voices of discontent arose among the students.<br/><br/>Only Fang Xingjian stayed focused on his sword training. His current goal was to perfect all levels of the three sword techniques he had learned.<br/><br/>He had also found some manual work the past nights, but it made him physically exhausted. The reduced hours of sleep also resulted in insufficient rest, which could harm his body in the long run.<br/><br/>He was planning on finding alternative ways of earning some money.<br/><br/>After the morning training that day, Kyle clapped his hands and called everyone over to him.<br/><br/>“All of you have been training hard. Ogden, how’s your Grizzly Bear Sword Technique?”<br/><br/>Ogden’s face lit up, saying, “Teacher, my Grizzly Bear Sword Technique has reached level 10. I’ve almost achieved 20 points in my strength and agility attributes. There’s hope for the Prefectural Selection now!”<br/><br/>Kyle nodded, looking satisfied. “Not bad. You were my biggest worry, but since you have reached level 10 in three sword techniques, I am relieved.”<br/><br/>Kyle continued, “I have decided to participate in this year’s Tournament of the Sword Heroes in The School of Sword Arts, and may not have time to teach the rest of you. From now on, I will pop by only once every morning. You have to train diligently by yourselves. Practicing the sword arts primarily depends on oneself.”<br/><br/>“Tournament of the Sword Heroes?” Fang Xingjian frowned. The Tournament of the Sword Heroes referred to the academy’s selection system, which emulated the Empire’s selections.<br/><br/>Apparently, Kyle leaving early and returning late, even the appearance of the black-haired Knight, and Kaunitz studying in The School of Sword Arts all probably served as preparation for the Tournament of the Sword Heroes.<br/><br/>Kyle went on, “Ogden, you have reached the maximum level for these three sword techniques, and you have also reached a bottleneck in the physical training of your body.<br/><br/>“From now until the Prefectural Selection, maintain your health and body condition. You can relax…<br/><br/>“Lambert, your reaction and flexibility are above Ogden’s, but remember to be modest. Your greatest weakness is that you underestimate the enemy too often…<br/><br/>“Xingjian, the time you’ve spent training is too short. Don’t be too nervous in this selection, just treat it like a rehearsal…”<br/><br/>At last, Kyle asked, “Oh, right. I will be away for a fairly long time. Who is willing to manage the school on my behalf?”<br/><br/>As his voice died out, all the students fell into silence. Evidently, the Prefectural Selection in four and a half months was on everyone’s minds, so they wanted to fully focus on their training. No one was willing to help Kyle with the school.<br/><br/>Kyle sighed and decided not to force them. As he was about to leave, Fang Xingjian raised his hands slowly, asking, “Are meals included?”<br/><br/>Kyle smiled and nodded. “Included.”

Chapter 17 Watch and Learn<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian heaved a sigh of relief. He had not expected the problem of food money to be resolved so easily. With this, he would be able to devote all his energy to sword practice.<br/><br/>As for helping Kyle with the management of the martial school… With his talent in the sword arts, he was not afraid to waste such a little amount of time. After all, there was not much work to be done now that The School of Sword Arts was so run down.<br/><br/>Following this, Fang Xingjian was called by Kyle to the side of the training grounds. Looking at this disciple of his, Kyle was very satisfied.<br/><br/>To him, Fang Xingjian was good in terms of both talent and moral quality. While it was understandable that the rest of the students had stayed silent, he could not help but feel disappointed.<br/><br/>“Xingjian, there aren’t many people in the school now, so there isn’t much work you need to do. Firstly, the food. However, since Aunty Akele has been working as a kitchen helper in The School of Sword Arts for over twenty years, she usually doesn’t make any mistakes. You just need to do a rough check.<br/><br/>“The next thing would be cleaning the place.<br/><br/>“And the organization of the tools, as well as their repair. If things are broken, you can head to the east of the city…<br/><br/>“I’ve kept the spare wooden swords in..<br/><br/>“As for cleaning the toilets, you can get the students to take turns cleaning them up…<br/><br/>“As for the dishes, since Aunty Akele is getting on in her age, you can help her out if she’s unable to manage…”<br/><br/>There were not many things to take care of, but Kyle listed out each issue in detail, and within the wink of an eye, over an hour had already passed.<br/><br/>He smiled and said, “I’ve become more naggy. Alright. I will still return to the school every night. If you have any problems, just ask me in the morning.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian nodded and said, “Teacher, please rest assured. I will make sure everything is settled.”<br/><br/>“Mmm.” Kyle took a look at Fang Xingjian, and seeing that he had no intention to leave, he asked, “Is there anything else?”<br/><br/>“Teacher…” Fang Xingjian hesitated for a moment before asking, “I’d like to learn another set of sword techniques…”<br/><br/>Kyle frowned and said, “Learn another set? Xingjian, you are truly talented. But still, you can’t bite off more than what you can chew. You must understand that each person’s energy is limited. Although you’re talented, it would be just your limit to fully master the Eagle Sword Technique, the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique and the Tenauer-Style Body Strengthening Sword Technique within two to three years. If you divert your energy to learning other sword techniques, it will delay your progress.<br/><br/>“You must understand that Ogden and the rest have already spent close to ten years doing tough training, but you’ve only just picked up these three sets of sword techniques.”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian had expected this, and presented the explanation he had prepared beforehand. “Teacher, I understand. It’s just that I’ve recently run into a bottleneck with these techniques’ training, and the increase in proficiency is lesser and lesser. Therefore, I’d like to take a look at other techniques so that I can draw reference from them, and see if I can gain further progress.”<br/><br/>“Draw reference?” Kyle laughed out loud and said, “With your puny sword skills now, if you were to look at other sword techniques which you hadn’t previously learned, it would only affect your mastery of the sword techniques you already know. It may even put obstacles in the way of your progress.<br/><br/>“Are you having these thoughts after meeting Kaunitz?”<br/><br/>Kyle shook his head. “Don’t compare yourself to him. He is truly a genius, and has received the full nurturing of the Tresia Clan since young. The food expenses spent on him so far could probably be more than enough to last you for ten generations.<br/><br/>“Moreover, he has also fully mastered Tresia’s sword techniques, and has come here only to pursue specialties.”<br/><br/>“Specialties?” asked Fang Xingjian, surprised.<br/><br/>“Mmm. A person’s fighting capacity is dependent on his attributes, skills and specialties. Kaunitz is picking up new sword techniques in order to complete the requirements for ‘Sword Specialist’, namely fully mastering ten sword techniques.”<br/><br/>“I see.”<br/><br/>Realization flashed in Fang Xingjian’s eyes. At the same time, he also understood that he would be unable to convince Kyle, and so he did not insist, but simply nodded in approval. After getting a few pointers from Kyle, he returned to the training grounds.<br/><br/>Thereafter, Kyle waved and called Ogden over to him.<br/><br/>“Ogden, you have now fully mastered all three basic sword techniques and have built a strong base for your muscles and bones. Now, I will impart to you our school’s Nine Yang Divine Sword Technique, Nine Yin Divine Sword Technique and Nine Heavenly Divine Sword Technique.”<br/><br/>Ogden was very agitated. “Nine Yang Divine Sword Technique, Nine Yin Divine Sword Technique and Nine Heavenly Divine Sword Technique?”<br/><br/>“That’s right. The Eagle Sword Technique, the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique, and the Tenauer-Style Body Strengthening Sword Technique all aim to train the muscles, and to toughen the bones, as well as the vital energy and blood. But the Nine Yang Divine Sword Technique, Nine Yin Divine Sword Technique and Nine Heavenly Divine Sword Technique are different. They were brought over from the other side of the world, when a few unparalleled swordsmen crossed the seas from the Western Land.”<br/><br/>Kyle continued, “These three are nurturing techniques which nurture and strengthen the organs, simultaneously improving one’s physique.<br/><br/>“Look at Kaunitz, his attributes far surpass yours. That’s because he has fully mastered all of Tresia’s basic sword techniques.<br/><br/>“It’s not just that his muscles and bones are as tough as rock, but his organs are also compact. His attacks, his body’s ability to absorb nutrition and his explosive power have all been greatly increased.<br/><br/>“Add to that the fact that he has been enjoying only the best food since young, and that he’s had an endless supplies of mystical medicinal supplies, and you’ll see the reason why he is able to surpass you by far in attributes.”<br/><br/>Ogden had now understood. “I see.” But, thinking of how he would also be taking up such sword techniques, he could not suppress the excitement in his heart.<br/><br/>“You must know, however, that out of these three sword techniques, I can only teach you the Nine Yang Divine Sword Technique. If you still wish to pick up the other two sword techniques, you must first pass the certification test[1] and join as an official member of The School of Sword Arts.”<br/><br/>Most factions and schools would only teach the students means to train up their muscles and bones, also known as external techniques.<br/><br/>As for the cultivation of internal strength, it required a more profound set of techniques, so students were merely given a little taste of it. Only those who passed the tests and enrolled as official members of the school would be allowed to learn them.<br/><br/>That is, unless the person was like Kaunitz who was a direct descendant of a great clan. Only then would one then be able to inherit the Tresia’s sword techniques which are only passed down to internal disciples, but yet still participate in the Grand Selection.<br/><br/>Kyle looked at Ogden and asked, “Now that you’ve fully mastered all three basic techniques, I will follow the custom and ask you. Do you want to enter The School of Sword Arts?”<br/><br/>Ogden stayed silent for a while before saying, “Teacher, could I give my reply after the Prefectural Selection?”<br/><br/>Kyle replied, “Do you think that’s possible?” He shook his head, disappointment flashing in his eyes. “Forget it, I will not force you. Let’s just carry on with the training.<br/><br/>“Remember that the Nine Yang Divine Sword Technique trains the organs. But how would mere humans be able to control the organs directly? The answer is that we need to use sword techniques in order to direct the blood flow towards the organs, and thus cultivate them from inside.<br/><br/>“Nine Yang refers to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, stomach, the small intestine, the large intestine, and the two kidneys.<br/><br/>“Through the Nine Yang Divine Sword Technique, use the movements of the muscles and bones to force the blood to move and massage the organs…”<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian had noticed Ogden being called over, and when he saw Kyle demonstrating a set of unfamiliar sword techniques, he raised his concentration to 120%.<br/><br/>Although he appeared to be practising his own sword technique, he was in fact focusing most of his energy on observing Kyle.<br/><br/>Two hours later, Kyle had ended his demonstration, and he was monitoring Ogden’s practice of the Nine Yang Divine Sword Technique, occasionally giving him some pointers. “No, no, you must relax your stance and imagine that you are compacted into a lump, focusing all your energy onto your stomach.<br/><br/>“Alright, alright, let’s stop here. I’ve taught you all I could. The rest relies on your own comprehension.”<br/><br/>Ogden looked at Kyle, who was leaving in a hurry, and sighed. He knew that his two recent choices had disappointed his teacher. Moreover, now that his teacher had to prepare for the Tournament of the Sword Heroes, it was impossible for him to focus all his attention on guiding his student.<br/><br/>Even so, he did not have any regrets. Moreover, joining The School of Sword Arts as an official member would not change his destiny. It would at most allow him to enjoy slightly better food and pick up more sword techniques.<br/><br/>Since he knew his own potential, he also knew that it would be highly improbable for him to reach the top as an official member in The School of Sword Arts.<br/><br/>In his life, he would be more than satisfied just to reach Kyle’s level of having gone through the first job transition.<br/><br/>Therefore, only by entering the Prefectural Selection, going through the first job transition and afterwards becoming a Knight could he change his destiny, as well as his family’s destiny.<br/><br/>While Ogden was still struggling with the comprehension of the Nine Yang Divine Sword Technique, Fang Xingjian had already raised it to level 1.<br/><br/>Given his supreme talent, although he could not hear Kyle’s explanation, he was already capable of picking up the technique in its depth even only through movement observation.<br/><br/>Suppressing the joy he was feeling, Fang Xingjian had to force himself not to practice the Nine Yang Divine Sword Technique for which he had already attained level 1.<br/><br/>[1] Internal assessment by The School of Sword Arts to see if one had the calibre to join as an official/internal students and thus have access to learn more high notch skills.

Chapter 18 Flattery<br/><br/>Over the next few days, Fang Xingjian practiced the basic sword techniques of The School of Sword Arts during the day, and secretly practiced the Nine Yang Divine Sword Technique at night. This sword technique was much more difficult than the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique, and so Fang Xingjian was learning this technique at a much slower pace.<br/><br/>Kaunitz had once again entered the limelight, this time on the training grounds.<br/><br/>The youngster from the Tresia Clan seemed to be in the limelight regardless of where he went. He would always be accompanied by a group of youngsters, even when he was practicing the Eagle Sword Technique by himself. The youngsters were both males and females who wanted to train with him, as if they were certain that they would improve by learning from him.<br/><br/>And every time Kaunitz stopped to take a break or pause to reflect, people would offer him snacks or refreshments, trying to get close to him.<br/><br/>“Young Master Kaunitz, would you like some water?”<br/><br/>“Young Master Kaunitz, you learn really fast. You must have already reached level 2 of the Eagle Sword Technique, right? As expected of the Tresia Clan’s genius.”<br/><br/>However, even when facing such flattery, Kaunitz did not bother smiling at them. His attitude stayed cool when he looked at the other students’ faces, meanwhile focusing his attention on the sword technique. However, a slight frown betrayed his impatience.<br/><br/>At that moment, Ogden stepped up and, as usual, dismissed the rest of the people. “Alright, alright, stop bothering Kaunitz. You’ll need to depend on yourselves in your training, and to pass the Prefectural Selection.”<br/><br/>Kaunitz nodded and spoke in a commanding tone, “You’re just in time. Show me moves twelve and thirty-three of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique.”<br/><br/>Ogden started the demonstration with pleasure. In fact, ever since the other party had arrived, he no longer trained together with Fang Xingjian, but stayed near Kaunitz. He practiced with him daily and had no qualms about sharing all of his experience of training the Eagle Sword Technique and the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique.<br/><br/>‘This is the heir to the Tresia Clan. As long as I maintain a good relationship with him, won’t the examiners for the Prefectural Selection also see me in a better light? Even if I am not able to pass the Prefectural Selection, if I can land myself a job in the Tresia Clan… No, it’s even better if I can get into Tresia Knight Academy!’<br/><br/>Ogden had the typical commoner’s sly manner of thinking. Pondering these things, he put more effort in swinging the wooden sword in his hand.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian did not care about Ogden’s flattery. This was reality, and this was how society worked. It was natural for those at the bottom of the ladder to do their best to flatter those above. If he had not gained his extraordinary talent in sword arts, he might have made the same choice as Ogden.<br/><br/>However, he had initially thought that Ogden was an honest and straightforward fellow. It seemed that it was only for show, as he was actually a scheming commoner following his own agenda.<br/><br/>“How can Eldest Martial Brother act like this?” Vivian bit her lips and said, “He was practicing with us before, and he looked so honest…. This… this is too…”<br/><br/>“What is it to you?” Fang Xingjian continued practicing the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique, planning to achieve its complete mastery. “We each choose our own paths, even if it’s relying on backdoors to enroll in academies or to pass the Prefectural Selection. When it comes to practicing martial arts, one can only rely on oneself.<br/><br/>“Attributes, techniques, and specialties don’t lie.”<br/><br/>Vivian turned around to look at Fang Xingjian. She gradually regained her concentration and focused on her sword practice once again.<br/><br/>During the past few days, Fang Xingjian had been making full use of his time, only practicing the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique. He had already reached level 29, and was not too far from reaching level 30.<br/><br/>As he waved the wooden sword in his hand, its afterimages seemed to be connected. Each time the sword slashed, its trembling would split the air, making a sound similar to a grizzly bear’s roar.<br/><br/>It rumbled explosively, as if gunpowder had been lit in the air. Fang Xingjian suddenly felt as if there were a huge tremor in his head. It was as if a thunderbolt had cut across the clear skies, making him see stars.<br/><br/>He was stunned for a moment, and then he felt a tingly numbness spread all over his body, as if he had been struck by lightning. His muscles and bones trembled three consecutive times before he managed to come back to his senses.<br/><br/>Grizzly Bear Sword Technique level 30: an additional 6 points in strength, 6 points in agility, increased toughness for his bones and organs, and a substantial increase in the body’s potential, along with its ability to recover from muscle and bone fatigue.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian felt as if his body was being continuously soaked in a hot spring. His bones and muscles were trembling in extremely slight movements, massaging and nurturing his body. The trembles also shook away all excess burdens, fully cleansing his body.<br/><br/>To think that level 30 of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique would be nurturing his body at all times, helping him increase his body’s potential, strengthening its constitution, and amassing energy!<br/><br/>Now his attributes had changed to:<br/><br/> Name<br/> Fang Xingjian<br/> Age<br/> 16<br/> Occupation<br/> Warrior’s Squire<br/> Level<br/> 9<br/> Strength<br/> 20<br/> Agility<br/> 24<br/> Reaction<br/> 11<br/> Endurance<br/> 8<br/> Flexibility<br/> 12<br/><br/>His strength was no longer below, but rather above Ogden’s and Lambert’s.<br/><br/>Fang Xingjian was overjoyed. At that moment, a noise broke out from the training grounds.<br/><br/>“He lost. Lambert lost too.”<br/><br/>“To think that both Eldest Martial Brother Ogden and Second Martial Brother Lambert have lost… This… this…”<br/><br/>“What’s there to be surprised about? This is Tresia’s super genius we are talking about. Kaunitz is too strong. He’s only been learning the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique for such a short time! We’ll never be able to catch up with this kind of talent in our whole lives.”<br/><br/>Kaunitz looked at the fallen Lambert as he shook his head and said, “Your attributes are too low, and you are unable to fully express the profoundness of the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique. There’s no benefit from training with you.”<br/><br/>Ogden, who was at the side, smiled as if he did not care about his loss at all. He took a look at the pale-faced Lambert and said, “After all, we are only mediocre in talent and we aren’t able to compare with a genius swordsman like you, Kaunitz. One day of your practice is equivalent to a few years’ worth of our training.”<br/><br/>Lambert’s chest heaved a few times, as if he had harsh words to say, but nevertheless, he did not speak up. Eventually, he picked up his sword and dashed out with a flushed face. He was obviously too embarrassed to stay there.<br/><br/>Kaunitz shook his head again, “Practicing the sword requires one to be bold, hardworking, and relentless. How are you going to learn if you can’t even put up with such minor humiliation?”<br/><br/>Saying that, he turned to look in Fang Xingjian’s direction, asking, “I heard that there’s another genius in The School of Sword Arts, who managed to pick up the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique on the first day?”<br/><br/>Ogden nodded and said, “That’s right. The teacher said that his foundation was very sturdy, and that he had already fully mastered a set of basic sword techniques. That was why he could easily pick up the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique.”<br/><br/>“A good foundation?” Kaunitz walked up to Fang Xingjian, saying, “I need a person to pair up with me and practice the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique together, breaking it down in stances. You can give it a go.” From his tone, it was as if he took the other party’s agreement for granted, making it sound as if this was actually an act of charity.<br/><br/>“Not interested.” Fang Xingjian did not even turn his head around as he switched to practicing the Eagle Sword Technique. He had perfected the Grizzly Bear Sword Technique up to level 30, and his next goal was to fully master the Eagle Sword Technique. He had no interest in exchanging blows with Kaunitz, nor was he interested in helping him.
